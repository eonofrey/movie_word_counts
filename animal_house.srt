MAN: Well, Chip,
I think you'll find

24
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,289
that Omega House
has more activities

25
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,249
than most of the other
fraternities on campus

26
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,876
and they're far superior,
I think...

- Mandy.
- Hi. Oh, right there.

28
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,508

and make yourselves at home

and don't be shy about helping
yourselves to punch and cookies.

34
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,668
Now, I'm not going to say that
Omega's the best house on campus

35
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,420
but a lot of outstanding guys

36
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,965
figure they'll pledge Omega,
or they won't pledge at all.

37
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,927
We do have more than
our share of campus leaders.

Well, sure.

the best, but I hate to seem

No.

161

After I graduate,
I'm gonna get drunk every night.

(HUMMING TANGO)

163
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,872
Boon, I think
I'm in love with a retard.

164
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,208
Is he bigger than me?

165
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,138
Greg,

166
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,351
what is the worst fraternity
on this campus?

167
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:10,521
That would be hard to say, sir.

168
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,325
They're each outstanding
in their own way...

169
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,527
Cut the horse shit, son.
I got their disciplinary files right here.

170
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:23,242
Who dumped a whole truckload
of Fizzies into the swim meet?

171
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:28,122
Who delivered the medical school
cadavers to the alumni dinner?

172
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:32,000
Every Halloween, the trees
are filled with underwear.

173
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,963
Every spring,
the toilets explode.

174
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,174
You're talking about Delta, sir.

175
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,886
Of course I'm talking
about Delta, you twerp!

176
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,014
This year,
it's gonna be different.

177
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,767
This year, we're going to grab
the bull by the balls

178
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,770
and kick those punks off campus.

179
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,441
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

180
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:56,525
They are?

181
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,609
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,986
Oh.

183
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,824
Then as of this moment,
they're on double secret probation.

184
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,285
Double secret probation, sir?

185
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,539
There is a little-known codicil in
the Faber College constitution

186
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,917
which gives the Dean unlimited
power to preserve order

187
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,170
in time of campus emergency.

188
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,340
Find me a way to
revoke Delta's charter.

189
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,552
You live next door.

190
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,471
Put Neidermeyer on it.

191
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,098
He's a sneaky little shit,
just like you, right?

192
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:33,479
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down

193
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,690
and that foot is me.

194
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,320
Larry Kroger. All in favor.

Who cares?
We need the dues.

Now wait.
Okay.

Okay, this guy is a real zero.
That's true.

206
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,694
Let's just think back
to when you guys were freshmen.

207
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:26,323
Boon, you had a face like
a pepperoni pizza, right?

208
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,617
And Stork here.

209
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,787
Everybody thought
the Stork was brain damaged.

210
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,748
I, myself, was so obnoxious

211
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,377
the seniors used to
beat me up once a week.

212
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,921
So this guy is a total loser?

213
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,467
Well, let me tell you
the story of another loser.

of John Milton's Paradise Lost?

Well, it's a very long poem.

240
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,760
It was written a long
time ago and I'm sure

a lot of you have
difficulty understanding

242
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,725
exactly what
Milton was trying to say.

243
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,853
Certainly we know
that he was trying

244
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:47,065
to describe the struggle
between good and evil, right?

245

Okay.

246
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:55,824
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

Satan.

Now was Milton
trying to tell us

00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,753
that being bad was
more fun than being good?

Don't write this down,
but I find Milton

probably as boring
as you find Milton.

Mrs. Milton found him boring,
too. He... He's a little bit long-winded.

00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,257
You'll say what?

481
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,010
I'll say what?

482
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,388
You said, "I'll say," when I said that
Eric Stratton should be put in jail.

483
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,890
I'm trying to figure out...
Darn it, Greg.

484
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:08,809
If you're not even gonna try,
I'm just gonna stop.

485
00:37:09,895 --> 00:37:11,145
Mandy, I...

486
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,246
Good night, Greg.

487
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,998
Good night, Mandy.

Her boyfriend.

And not your boyfriend?
Not my boyfriend.

493
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,336
Speaking of boyfriends,
Mandy, how was your date with Greg?

494
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:01,505
Good night.

We're in trouble.

501
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,734
I just checked with the
guys at the Jewish house

502
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,399
and they said that every one of our
answers on the psych test were wrong.

00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,942
Every one?

504
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,948
Those assholes must have stolen
the wrong fucking exam.

505
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,164
Oh, God, look
what just creeped in.

506
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,166
Well, well, well.

507
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,632
Looks like somebody forgot there's
a rule against alcoholic beverages

508
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:33,759
in fraternities on probation.

509
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,052
What a tool.

510
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,887
I didn't get that, son.
What was that?

511
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,139
I said what a shame

512
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:44,019
that a few bad apples have to spoil
a good time for everyone

513
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,813
by breaking the rules.
Put a sock in it, boy

514
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,816
or else you'll be out of here
like shit through a goose.

Yes, sir.

Now, have you boys seen
your grade point average, yet?

Well, have you?

518
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,534
I have, sir.

519
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:00,980
I know it's a little
below par...

520
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:04,373
It's more than a little
below par, Mr. Hoover.

521
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,791
It stinks!

522
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:10,545
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history!

Well, sir,

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,384
we're hoping that our midterm

because you clowns have been
on double secret probation

00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,810
since the beginning
of this semester.

529
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,437
Double secret probation?

530
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:30,065
And that means,
one more slip-up,

531
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,858
one more mistake,

532
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,696
and this fraternity
of yours has had it

533
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,572
at Faber.

534
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,622
Well, that was pleasant. Nice of
him to stop by, don't you think?

535
00:43:45,707 --> 00:43:48,709
We've gotta do something.
He's serious this time.

536
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,419
I think he knows
about the exams.

537

He's right. You're right.
We gotta do something.

538
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Absolutely.
You know what we gotta do?

Toga party.

540
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,094
We're on double secret
probation, whatever that is.

541
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,138
We can't afford
to have a toga party.

542

the idea, Hoov.

Oh, Otter,
please don't do this.

nail us no matter what we do.

So we might as well
have a good time.

Honestly, Boon,
you're 21 years old.

In six months,
you're gonna graduate,

553
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,846
and tomorrow night you're gonna
wrap yourself up in a bed sheet

554
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,766
and pour grain alcohol
all over your head.

555
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,810
It's cute, but I think
I'll pass this time.

556
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:50,687
Want me to go alone?

557
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:53,190
Baby, I don't want
you to go at all.

558
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,321
It's a fraternity party. I'm in
the fraternity. How can I miss it?

559
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:03,533
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

and keep your sweater closed.

579

Hey, I could get in trouble.

580
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:24,364
That's right.
So, be cool.

581

I beg your pardon?

Oh, my cucumber.
It's bigger.

584
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,138
Vegetables can be
really sensuous, don't you think?

585
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:49,973
No.

586
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,809
Vegetables are sensual.

587
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,520
People are sensuous.

588
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,732
Right. Sensual.
That's what I meant.

589
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:01,193

is Eric Stratton.

Dean Wormer at Faber.

You still want to
show me your cucumber?

596
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,638
Nothing for me today, thanks.

597

It looks like you gained
some weight since you came in.

It's just a prank.
I'm pledging a fraternity.

Don't sweat it, sweetie.
I won't tell.

Well, we're having a little party
at the Delta Tau Chi house tonight

601
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,656
and you are cordially invited.

602
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,619
I'm old enough to be
your mother. Almost.

603
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:57,874
Besides, I have to go to the
goddamn senior honors dinner tonight.

604
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:01,336
Well, maybe some other time.

605
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,048
Doubtful.

606
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,008
Maybe?

607
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,720
So if you're not busy, you
wanna go to a fraternity party?

608
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,389
Will I be home by 12:00?

609
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:15,892
Sure. Any time you want.
I'll pick you up at...

610
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:19,396
My dad would kill me if he knew
I was going to a frat house.

611
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,814
Is it okay if I meet you there?

612
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,399
Is it okay?

613
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,984
It's terrific!

(TWISTING THE NIGHT AWAY PLAYING)

Well, girls, welcome to the
Delta toga party. Come in.

616
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,999
Here, let me take your coat.

617
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,168
Great pair of togas.

618
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,921
Hey, why don't you help yourself
to some delicious Delta punch

619
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,965
and I'll join you in a minute.

620
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,758
Otter, this is Sissy,
my steady girl, Sissy.

621
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,802
- Sis, this is the guy I was telling you about.
- Hi.

622
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,639
Wow. You're even prettier
than Kent said you were.

623
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:38,141
What a great dress.
Yeah.

624
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,061
Listen, you two talk while
I get some punch for us, okay?

625
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,729
Good idea.
All right.

626
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:48,193
Kent's really a lucky guy.
Why don't we go sit down somewhere?

627
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:59,496
I gave my love a cherry

628
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:04,209
That had no stone

629
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:09,005
I gave my love a chicken

630
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:13,259
That had no bones

631
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:18,306
I gave my love a story

632
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:22,644
That had no end

633
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,396
I gave

634
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:34,864
Sorry.

635
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,329
Hi.
Hi.

636
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,540
You look great.
So do you.

637
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,755
I had to wait

01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:32,345
My advice to you is
to start drinking heavily.

955
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,808
You'd better listen to him,
Flounder. He's in Pre-Med.

just leave everything to me.

958
01:21:55,202 --> 01:21:56,494
Hi, Katy.

959
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,001
I missed you.

960
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,838
- Boon, I was gonna try and call you...
MAN: Where are they, Katy?

961
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,137
Boon, I don't know what to say.

962
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:17,974
(DOOR SLAMMING) Boon, wait!

963
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:22,353
Shit.
Must be in the kitchen.

964
01:22:25,983 --> 01:22:27,650
What's the matter?

965
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,451
Yeah, there they are.

966
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:41,039
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

967
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:44,959
Well, I'm sure I don't know,
Otter. You'll just have to ask her,

968
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,087
as soon as you can get there.

969
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:54,135
Well, do you know the
Rainbow Motel on Old Mill Road?

970
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,056
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:22:58,599 --> 01:22:59,682
Bye.

Teddy!

973
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,609
Did you get the grade reports
on the Deltas yet?

974
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:13,237
Yes, I have it right here.

01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,407

One, two, three, four, five.

a couple of flowers short,

so some of you boys
are gonna have to...

984
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:11,212
Where are the other two?
Stratton and Schoenstein?

985
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,548
We looked everywhere,
sir, but...

986
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,591
Never mind, it doesn't matter.

987
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:19,137
You gentlemen seen
your midterm grades yet?

988
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:21,097
Well, they're not
posted yet, sir.

989
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:22,974
I've seen them.

990
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:28,479
Mr. Kroger, two C's,
two D's, and an F.

991
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,023
That's a 1.2 grade average.

992
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,819
Congratulations, Kroger, you're at
the top of the Delta pledge class.

993
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:38,865
Mr. Dorfman.

Hello.

0.2.

Fat, drunk, and stupid is
no way to go through life, son.

Mr. Hoover,
president of Delta House, 1.6.

Four C's and an F,
a fine example you set.

999
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:03,723
Daniel Simpson Day
has no grade point average.

All courses incomplete.

1001

Now, I want you to tell Mr. Stratton
and Mr. Schoenstein

1005
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:26,287
exactly what I'm about
to tell you now.

1006
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,455
What's that, sir?

1007
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,249
You're out. Finished
at Faber. Expelled.

1008
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:33,586
I want you off this campus at
9:00 Monday morning!

1009
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,216
And I'm sure
you'll be happy to know

1010
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:42,804
that I have notified
your local draft boards

1011
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,847
and told them that
you are now all...

All eligible
for military service.

1013
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,400
Well?

1014
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,408
Out with it.

Relax, Greg, honey.

1018
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:24,971
You know, I know, everybody knows
that Otter certainly had it coming.

1019
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,017
I don't think the Deltas
will be giving us any more trouble.

1020
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:31,102
No.

1021
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,274
Greg, honey, is it
supposed to be this soft?

1022
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:41,737
Christ!

1023
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,533
Seven years of college
down the drain.

1024
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,120
Might as well join
the fucking Peace Corps.

1025
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,247
My mother's gonna kill me.

1026
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:56,711
I knew it. I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

1027
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:02,049
I can't believe I threw up
in front of Dean Wormer.

1028
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:06,345
Face it, Kent.
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

Jesus Christ. What happened?
You look grotesque.

1031
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,829
Some of the Omegas
did a little dance on my face.

1032
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,456
Who was it?

1033
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:40,713
It was Greggie and Dougie
and some of the other Hitler youth.

1034
01:27:40,964 --> 01:27:42,673
Why, what'd you do?

1035
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:46,052
I don't know. They're
just animals, I guess.

1036
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:52,350
Looks like I missed something.

1037
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,185
Yeah, you did.

1038
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,646
We're all officially
kicked out of school.

1039
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:58,356
Wormer just got our grades.

1040
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:04,070
They kicked us out of school?
That makes sense.

1041

Hey! What's this
lying around shit?

1042

What the hell are we
supposed to do, you moron?

1043
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,287
War's over, man.
Wormer dropped the big one.

1044
01:28:13,372 --> 01:28:16,999
What? Over?
Did you say, "over"?

1045
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:20,419
Nothing is over
until we decide it is!

1046
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,756
Was it over when the Germans
bombed Pearl Harbor?

1047
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,676
- Hell, no!
- Germans?

1048
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:27,802
Forget it, he's rolling.

1049
01:28:27,886 --> 01:28:29,720
And it ain't over now

1050
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:33,057
because when
the going gets tough,

1051
01:28:39,398 --> 01:28:41,023
the tough get going!

(YELLING)

1054
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,585
What the fuck happened to
the Delta I used to know?

1055
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,046
Where's the spirit?

1056
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:07,675
Where's the guts, huh?

1057
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:14,056
This could be the greatest
night of our lives,

1058
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,976
but you're gonna
let it be the worst.

1059

"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

1060
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,525
Well, just kiss
my ass from now on!

1061
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:27,570
Not me!
I'm not gonna take this!

1062
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:31,991
Wormer, he's a dead man!
Marmalard, dead!

1063
01:29:32,409 --> 01:29:34,869
- Neidermeyer?
- Dead.

1064
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,079
Bluto's right.

1065
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,958
Psychotic,
but absolutely right.

1066
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:44,795
We got to take these bastards.

1067
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:50,468
Now, we could fight them
with conventional weapons,

1068
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:55,097
but that could take years
and cost millions of lives.

1069
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,308
No, no, no.

1070
01:29:58,435 --> 01:30:03,355
No. In this case,
I think we have to go all out.

1071
01:30:04,983 --> 01:30:08,277
I think this situation
absolutely requires

1072
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:13,115
a really futile
and stupid gesture

1073
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,618
be done on somebody's part.

1074
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,204
We're just the guys to do it.

1075
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:27,588
Let's do it.
Let's do it!

1076
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:33,010
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Hi.
Hi.

01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:33,112
I'm Larry. Remember me,
I took you to the party?

1080
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,239
Wait a minute.

1081
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,121
(DOOR OPENING)

1082
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,501
So, how come you show up now?
I didn't expect to see you.

1083
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:50,921
Well, I never got a chance to say
good night to you after the party.

1084
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:53,591
No kidding.
They almost pumped my stomach.

1085
01:31:53,675 --> 01:31:56,552
Look, is it okay if we go
for a walk or something?

1086
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,762
What do you mean,
"or something?"

1087
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,306
Well, I could get some beer.

1088
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,768
No, not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

1089
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:15,529
Before we go any further,
there's something I have to tell you.

1090
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,490
I lied to you,
I've never done this before.

1091
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,701
You've never made out
with a girl before?

1092
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,411
No. No, I mean,

1093
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:24,371
I've never done what I think
we're gonna do in a minute.

1094
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:25,777
I sort of did once,
but I was...

1095
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:27,833
That's okay, Larry,
neither have I.

1096
01:32:30,629 --> 01:32:33,714
And besides,
I lied to you, too.

1097
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:35,382
Oh, yeah? What about?

1098
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,926
I'm only 13.

Yes, well,

Pardon me. Excuse me, please.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Okay, kid, off that mailbox.

That's government property.
Come on, let's go. Move, move it.

Excuse me, please.
