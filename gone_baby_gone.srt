PATRICK: I always believed
it was the things you don't choose

00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,627
that makes you who you are.

3
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,298
Your city.

4
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,300
Your neighbourhood.

5
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,636
Your family.

6
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,726
People here take pride in these things.

00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,729
Like it was something
they'd accomplished.

The bodies around their souls.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,655
The cities wrapped around those.

10
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,016
I lived on this block my whole life.

Most of these people have.

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,858
When yourjob is to find people
who are missing,

13
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,611
it helps to know where they started.

14
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,407
I find the people
who started in the cracks,

15
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,368
and then fell through.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,668
This city can be hard.

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,632
When I was young, I asked my priest
how you could get to heaven

18
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,344
and still protect yourself
from all the evil in the world.

to his children.

The thing is, she always
had a smile on her face.

29

That was her. She was always smiling.

Little bit.
I was a freshman, she was a senior.

She was blowing Mike Gulley
down the post

when he was still 14 and innocent
and milking cows up Vermont.

I don't know about innocent.

may be carrying a little girl of her own.

I have to apologise.

- No. It's not that.

The cops don't want me coming here.

- Don't worry.

- No, it's not that we don't want the job...

before we make decisions like these.

Yeah, when our folks died
they left us a unit and my sister a unit,

140
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,155
so, you know,
basically we got no choice.

141
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,364
And with the acoustics
in the apartment,

142
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,532
you can't get away from it.

Why don't you just
come over the house, all right?

00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,537
- Just talk to Helene, you know.
- BEA: Lionel, talk to Helene?

but she's hurting right now.

Bea straightened me out.

00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,884
My sister Helene has not had that.

150
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,763
Talking to the mother's
the least we could do.

151
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,932
- We'll come right over.
- Thanks a lot.

He may look young,

he'd better not act it.

and by law he's entitled
as her representative

to be cooperated with

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,973
Bullshit. She was in here for, like,
two hours bumping rails. Oh, yeah.

310
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,560
- ANGIE: What time did she come in?
- 8:00.

311
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,771
- Are you sure it was the same night?
- Fucking positive,

312
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,941
'cause she was in the shitter,
fucking banging down rails with Ray,

313
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,567
and I was banging on the fucking door.

314
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,820
- Who, Ray? Skinny Ray?
- Yeah. Ray Likanski.

315
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,530
He's in there ducking me
like a fucking faggot.

316

I was banging on the door.

317
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,865
He thought I didn't know
he was in there,

318
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,534
but I know he's fucking in there.

319
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,662
- Don't lend him any money...
- Hey, Stevie.

320
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:46,666
- What the fuck you doing?
- Nothing. What's up, Lenny?

321
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,835
Don't talk about people you don't know.

322
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,169
What do you mean?
These are my friends.

323
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,421
- I know them for years.
- What's the problem, guy?

324
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,715
You said you weren't a cop.
Right, "guy"?

325
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,510
- Yeah, I'm not a cop.
- Yeah, then why don't you fuck off?

326
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,387
Why don't you mind your business?

327
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,848
He's gonna come in here
and be a smartass?

328

You're awfully worried
about people's asses there, Dave.

329
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,645
Yeah, you probably got
a fucking ass like a Skippy jar.

find her daughter. Is that all right?

00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,695
Listen, don't come in here
running your mouth,

333
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,446
thinking you're better than me.

334
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,699
I'm not the fucking one.

335
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,659

- LENNY: Cool it.

is the matter with you guys?

We're leaving, all right?

You know, Dave,
I think it's your good looks...

341
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,732
'Cause there is some fine pussy
in here tonight.

342
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,618
Open that door, rummy.

343
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,622
- Open the door, Mike.
- Now.

You ever wanna get fucked,
let me know.

- Fuck you!

- Make it!
- Get the fuck out.

Make me a fucking martini,
you fat fucking retard!

No! I just...

(PATRICK EXCLAIMS)

368
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,733
The Tretts were released six
and eight months ago, respectively.

369
00:21:58,817 --> 00:21:59,942
They have drug habits.

370
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,778
We don't know where they are,
but we think Corwin's with them.

371
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,449
Jailhouse snitch claims
that Corwin confided in him

372
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,202
and told him when he got out,
he was gonna move in with his family.

373
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,954
Apparently the three of them

374
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,999
have some kind of
Addams Family deal going on.

375
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,419
Corwin's plan is to keep a kid
in the house to have sex with.

376
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,922
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Not for Amanda, it doesn't.

377
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,299
ANGIE: Do you think
this is who has Amanda?

378
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,800
Well, there's a lot
of holes in our theory.

379
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,094
I mean, Corwin likes
little boys, you know?

380
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,014
He likes them seven or eight or nine.

So that's it, that's all we got,
there's no other leads, three days in?

382
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,479
No, we got more.

383
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,106
We got six psychics telling us to look
in six different states,

384
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,900
we got Lionel and Bea
with airtight alibis,

385
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,610
we've interviewed every neighbour
in a mile radius

386
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,445
and we got a convicted finger-blaster

387
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,197
who just happened
to cut off his ankle bracelet.

388
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,323
- Take it easy...
- No, no, no, no, no!

00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,408
Who the fuck is this guy?

You're here because Jack Doyle
had us extend you a courtesy.

You got something to contribute,

Otherwise, hey, you...

You know, you can go back
to your Harry Potter book.

394
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,672
Isn't it usually somebody
who knows the victim?

395
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,051
I think there's plenty of people
in Helene McCready's life

396
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,428
that are capable of doing this.

397
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,099
So then you probably
talked to Ray Likanski.

398
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,351
- Who?
- Ray Likanski.

399
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:19,939
"Skinny Ray," they call him, 6'2",
about 160 pounds.

Does blow. Helene's boyfriend. No?

401
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,654
- Never heard of him.
- Well, with all due respect,

402
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,906
I think we might be able
to contribute on that point.

403
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,575
- Really? How's that?
- The night Amanda went missing,

404
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,160
Skinny Ray was down
at the Fillmore Lounge

405
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,496
doing coke for two hours,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

406
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,956
Fascinating.

407
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,168
- With Helene McCready.
- You're shitting me.

Well, it all depends

I mean, you might think that you're
more from here than me, for example.

I know people like this?

doing people's taxes.

Yeah, I don't pay my rent

while the kid was taken.

- With Skinny Ray.
- Skinny Ray is a fucking bitch.

438

- I thought Ray was your boy.
- Work for me?

439
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,793
Skinny Ray, he's a fucking cokehead.
He works for the Haitian.

440
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,128
Ray works for Cheese?

441
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,758
Yeah, Cheese, Ray, Chris Mullen,
whole trash-picker crew.

442
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,510
Did you ever sell to Helene?

443

There's reasons why
there ain't three inches of Plexiglas

between us right now.

00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,599
That's 'cause I don't fuck
with skeezers like Helene.

446
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,100
Or coconuts like Cheese.

447

You should know better by now.

448
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,771
I'm the king of this
motherfucking jungle.

449

No. No.

or something, isn't he?

Helene, who is he?

- He's just a guy, Lionel.
- REMY: Thank you.

He is, among other things,

- What other things?
- I don't know.

your brother's questions, Helene?

You don't disrespect my wife,

and you don't make racial remarks
in my kitchen.

469

- It's my kitchen, Lionel.

Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
Take it easy.

472

He's a drug dealer, a pimp,
a pornographer. All right?

00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,840
LIONEL: Perfect.
You associate with a pimp.

BEA: A pornographer? Helene.

475

NICK: And we think he rolled up
Pokey Jackson in a carpet

476
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,722
and shot him in the head
on Castlegate, so there's that, too.

Lionel, what does that mean?

It means she's a drug runner, Bea.
It means she carries drugs.

his question, Helene.

- Not if you snort it. Right, sugar?

Yeah, less addictive that way.

- No.

'Course I do.

00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:42,928
And we know you took the money.
So just tell us how much you took.

00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,304
How much?

00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,977
How much?

516
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,980
How much?

517
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,650

Yeah.

When we was walking back
through the motel with all the money,

these cops just swooped right in,
went right for the bikers,

so we just pretended to be like a family.

- Fuck youse both.

Should we bring in the FBl
at this point?

Fastest way to get Amanda home

622
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,178
is go to Cheese,
swap the money for her and walk away.

- Plain and simple.
- Do you know Cheese?

Knew his brother better, Jude.
He was a sweet kid.

- NICK: (CHUCKLES) Ask Ray.

All right, listen.
All he cares about is his money.

628
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,029
If he gets it back...
He's not gonna hurt Amanda.

629
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:19,616
Just keep your mouth shut, okay?
We'll get her back. It'll be fine.

630
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,035

- Yeah, that's the idea.

00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,204
Okay. Well, tell him I'm sorry, all right?

632
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,957
I mean, he knows me,
just tell him I apologise.

633
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,876
Yeah, I'm sure that'll fix everything.
Just take her home.

That's what she said to me
right before I put her to bed.

639

She said, "I'm hungry."
I mean, they fed her, right?

She's not still hungry?

He was at the club
when we made the offer.

My only child was murdered.
She was 12. Did you hear about it?

What you probably didn't hear,

and what I hope
you never have to deal with,

825
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:59,125
Miss Gennaro, is what that feels like.
What I have to deal with.

826
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,754
Knowing that my little girl likely died

827

crying out for me
to come and save her.

828

And I never did.

829
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:16,017

in a shallow ditch bank

830

by the side of the road
not 10 minutes from my house.

me or if she blamed herself.

But when she didn't think I was home,

that we never understood

and never return...

Amanda was even more haunting
for never being found.

937

What they did find
was another big story,

938

01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,175
He couldn't find enough guys to rat out.

1081
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,344
Anyway, he tells us there's a guy
pumping up in an apartment

1082
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,512
up in Columbia Point.

1083
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,432
We go in, me and Nicky.

1084
01:10:29,516 --> 01:10:33,811
Fifteen years ago, when Nicky went in,
it was no joke.

1085
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,939
So, it's a... It's a stash house, right?

1086
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:39,901
The old lady's beat to shit,
the husband's mean, cracked out,

1087
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:43,696
tries to give us trouble,
Nicky lays him down.

1088
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,740
We're doing an inventory,
but it looks like we messed up

1089
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:49,160
because there's no dope in the house,
and I go in the back room...

1090
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:52,747
Now, this place
was a shithole, mind you.

1091
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:56,459
Rats, roaches all over the place.

1092
01:10:56,543 --> 01:10:59,712
But the kid's room, in the back,

1093
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:02,674
was spotless.

1094
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:07,720
No, I mean, he swept it, mopped it,
it was immaculate.

1095
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:10,640
The little boy's sitting on the bed

1096
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:14,185
holding onto his PlayStation
for dear life.

1097
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,771
There's no expression on his face,

1098
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:20,566
tears streaming down.

1099
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:25,738
He wants to tell me he just learnt
his multiplication tables.

1100
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:26,990
Christ.

1101
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:29,659
I mean, the father's got him
in this crack den,

1102
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:32,412
subsisting on Twinkies
and ass-whippings,

1103
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:38,126
and this little boy just wants someone
to tell him that he's doing a good job.

1104
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:42,588
You're worried what's Catholic?

1105
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:44,799
I mean, kids forgive.

1106
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:49,053
Kids don't judge.

1107
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,431
Kids turn the other cheek.

1108
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,434
What do they get for it?

1109
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,686
So I went back out there,

1110
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,855
I put an ounce of heroin
on the living room floor,

1111
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:02,275
and I sent the father on a ride,
seven to nine.

1112
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:08,489
- That was the right thing?
- Fucking A!

1113
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,952
You gotta take a side.

1114
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,958
You molest a child, you beat a child,

1115
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,753
you're not on my side.

1116
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,317
If you see me coming, you better run,

1117
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,257
because I am gonna
lay you the fuck down!

1118
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,346
Easy.

1119
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:38,811
Don't feel easy.

1120
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,773
Is the kid better off without his father?

1121
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:43,733
Yeah.

1122
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,653
But okay, I mean,
could be out there right now,

1123
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:50,281
pumping with a gun in his waistband.

1124
01:12:50,991 --> 01:12:52,825
It's a war, man.

1125
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,953
Are we winning?

1126
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,040
No.

1127
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:08,299
Would you do it again?
Clip Corwin Earle?

1128
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:12,303
No.

1129
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:16,933
Does that make you right?

1130
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,520
Hmm?

1131
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:22,897
I don't know.

1132
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,441
Doesn't make it wrong, though,
does it?

(SIGHS)

1134
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:44,043
- Hey.
- Hi.

1135
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:47,880
How's Remy?

1136
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:51,134
He lied to me.

1137
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,346
What did Remy say about Ray
back in Roxbury?

1138
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,223
- Never heard of him.
- Never heard of him.

1139
01:13:57,307 --> 01:14:00,393
Now he says Ray's been snitching
for him for 15 years.

1140
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:02,645
He called him his "old pal."

1141
01:14:02,729 --> 01:14:05,565
Said he couldn't find
enough people to snitch out.

1142
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:06,899
Patrick...

1143
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:09,944
And Ray Likanski is the reason
Amanda got taken in the first place,

1144
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:12,196
and Remy lies about knowing him.

1145
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,742
Let it go.

1146
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,370
Why would he lie?
What's he have to hide?

1147
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,456
Amanda's dead.

1148
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,624
Let it go.

1151
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,179
Nick died.

1152
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,777
Left. Left.

1153
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,869
Mr Kenzie.

1154
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,122
Nice fucking job on Corwin Earle.

(PRAYING IN LATIN)

1156
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,013
Amen.

1157

(PRAYING IN LATIN)

1158
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,510
- Sorry about Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1159
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:03,182
I was thinking about our conversation
the other night.

1160
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,434
Well, I said some things
I shouldn't have.

1161
01:16:05,519 --> 01:16:08,104
You know, too much rum.

1162
01:16:08,188 --> 01:16:09,855
Yeah, like what?

1163
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:14,360
Don't fuck with me, Patrick. Not today.

1164
01:16:15,362 --> 01:16:17,780
Oh, I wouldn't fuck with you.

1165
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:22,868
Oh, you wanna play it like that, huh?
Okay.

1166
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,707
Forget about the other night,
and we'll be friends.

1167
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,544
What if I don't?

1168
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:35,047
That's not an "if"
you wanna bring into your life.

1169
01:16:38,218 --> 01:16:39,594
MAN: Had lunch with him last week.

1170
01:16:39,678 --> 01:16:40,845
Dana had lunch with him last week?

1171
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,388
Excuse me.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,182
Hey, Dev.

1174
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:49,061
- Hey, how you doing?
- All right, how you been?

1175
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,272
I can't complain.

1176
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,774
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

1177
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,652
Not here.

1178
01:16:56,737 --> 01:17:00,114
(SCOFFS) If it's like that, then
you're gonna have to buy me lunch.

1179
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,868
- How's the Chart House, half hour?
- Sounds about right.

1180
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,705
Hey, Remy used to work Narcotics
with you, right?

1181
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,498
DCU, yeah. What's up?

1182
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,083
Why'd he leave?

1183
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:14,712
Had a habit ofjust
rubbing people the wrong way.

1184
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,881
Like what? What'd he do?

1185
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:19,383
Like marry a prostitute, for one.

1186
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,551
Come on.

1187
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,345
Might not wanna do that
if you're a cop, right?

1188
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,013
Might not wanna do that
if you're a plumber.

(LAUGHING)

1190
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:27,892
So, what happened?

1191
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:30,519
He says he loves her,
tells Mike Snell to go fuck himself,

1192
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:31,729
and puts in for a transfer.

1193
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:32,897
What, to Doyle?

1194
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:36,692
Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana, back in '72.

1195
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:40,196
You don't think that Remy's
dirty, though, do you?

1196
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,114
What's "dirty"?

1197
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:46,994
- I know he planted evidence once.
- Oh, you do?

1198
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,539
Yeah. Why?

Look, man. CSl is killing us out here.

Every other juror, all they wanna know
is where the microfibres are.

Certain people are workers.

1202
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,341
Don't wanna plant it,
but you know how it is.

1203
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:02,593
So they don't mind it.

1204
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:08,265
So tell me something,
what you fucking with him for?

1205
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,144
He lied to me.

1206
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,480
I can't think of one reason
big enough for him to lie

1207
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:17,191
that's small enough not to matter.

1208
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:23,823
All right, look.

1209
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:28,369
I know one thing, but it's third party,
so you gotta play it like that.

Helene and Ray took Cheese's money
back in June, right?

Yeah.

One week later,
Remy goes to a cop in DCU

1213
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,129
asking if anybody knew
who robbed Cheese.

1214
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,422
So what?

1215
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,257
So my informant tells me,

1216
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:44,844
Cheese didn't even know
he got robbed until two weeks later.

1217
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,972
So Remy knew Cheese got robbed
before Cheese did?

1218
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,974
How'd he know that?

1219
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,935
Let me tell you something.

1220
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,061
You better think long and hard

1221
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,148
before you start running around here
investigating the police.

1222

You try and take food out their mouths,
and they will fuck you up.

Thanks for the steak.

1224
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:08,993
All right.

01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,758
Hey.

01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,344

1229
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:34,185
About the acoustics in your apartment.

01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:35,811
What?

1231
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,772
Oh, we live
in a three-decker, too, Lionel.

1232
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,690
I got nothing to talk about.

1233
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,860
Well, that's fine.
We can talk to the state police.

Meet me at Murphy's Law.

1235

LIONEL ON PHONE: I don't meet him
down Murphy's,

he's gonna call the staties.

01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:10,054
REMY ON PHONE: He's putting a
move on you. Don't go down there.

1238
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:12,056
I can handle Patrick Kenzie.

1239
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,902
- This is an oath we took.
- I started this.

1240
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:15,893
- This has to be protected.
- I got things to protect, too.

1241
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:17,061
- Listen to me!
- All right, Remy.

1242
01:20:17,187 --> 01:20:19,480
You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me.

1243
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,899
- Just trust me, all right?
- No! Trust me!

1244
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:26,612
Where I come from,
you die with your secrets!

1245
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:55,266
How long have you known Remy?

1246
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,477
Detective Bressant? Just in...

1247
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,814
Met him through
the investigation of Amanda.

1248
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,899
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1249
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:09,446
How long you known Remy?

1250
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,657
What is this?

1251
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,702
They got the Internet, now, Lionel.

1252
01:21:14,786 --> 01:21:17,121
You know how it is in town.
Everybody knows everybody.

1253
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:19,665
No. Everybody don't know everybody.

1254
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:21,250
- What're you talking about?
- Why you lying?

1255
01:21:21,334 --> 01:21:22,459
I'm not.

1256
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,296
You bragged about taking a hard bust
on the first day we met you.

1257
01:21:25,422 --> 01:21:26,922
- No, I didn't.
- Bullshit.

1258
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:29,527
You're hiding something, Lionel,
and you better fucking tell it,

1259
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,469
'cause you came to our house
and you asked us for help.

1260
01:21:32,596 --> 01:21:34,805
And we killed ourselves
trying to save Amanda.

1261
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,682
And I know you ain't being 100%
with me right now,

1262
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,684
and it's really fucking pissing me off
that you're lying,

1263
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:41,228
so you better interrupt me at any time,
'cause I'm about to lose...

1264
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,189
Okay. Fine, fine. All right?
Don't have a heart attack.

1265
01:21:45,358 --> 01:21:47,484
I haven't been honest with you.

1266
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:50,529
It's just not something I'm proud of.
You know?

1267
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:53,490
I got in a bar fight back in the day.

1268
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:54,783
The other guy cracked his skull.

1269
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,328
At some point,
I must've said, "I'll kill you."

1270
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,790
So they had me up for attempted.
It's my word against this other guy's.

1271
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,627
Witness testified to my version
and the jury believed him.

1272
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,588
- 'Cause he was a cop.
- Yeah, he testified for me.

1273
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:09,340
So you knew Detective Bressant.

1274
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,675
- It's not like we were best friends.
- But you lied.

1275
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:15,012
- Why did you call Remy?
- He's a cop.

1276
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,931
- That's not why you called him, Lionel.
- Come on.

1277
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,849
It's a small place.
You heard them arguing.

1278
01:22:18,975 --> 01:22:20,517
- They were being loud.
- Who? Who... Who...

1279
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:25,022
So you called Remy, and you and him
took Amanda to blackmail your sister.

1280
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:26,482
(SCOFFS)

1281
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:29,818
Why would I do that?

1282
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,905
I don't know, Lionel. I really don't know.

1283
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,991
Maybe because after all the
"I put the fucking plug in the jug,"

1284
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,035
and the "count your blessings"
and the "watch your language,"

1285
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,287
you're just like everybody else.

1286
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,247
You saw a bag of money
and you wanted it.

1287
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,916
And you thought
you could get away with it.

1288
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:46,126
But Bea called the media
and made a big thing of it.

1289
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,545
And then she called us,
and then you were fucked.

1290
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:50,756
The case is closed, Patrick.
The case is closed.

1291
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,133
Coke-dealing Haitian's
a pretty easy target for a frame.

1292
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:54,510
- Lionel?
- Excuse me.

1293
01:22:54,594 --> 01:22:55,636
- Look at me.
- Okay. Excuse me.

1294
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,346
You took your niece,
and you laid it off on a black guy.

1295
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:58,639
- Pardon me.
- Lionel, tell me what happened.

1296
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,849
Can I get some service?

1297
01:23:00,934 --> 01:23:02,267
Yeah.

1298
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,523
(EXHALES)

1299
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:10,442
What?

1300
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,197
- Three shots of Cutty and a tallboy.
- Yeah.

1301
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:16,740
Thank you.

1302
01:23:18,076 --> 01:23:20,077
Just give me a second.

1303
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:54,278
Twenty-three years
is something, right?

1304
01:24:06,958 --> 01:24:08,292
Go.

1305
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:15,632
I come up to check on Amanda.
She was alone as usual.

1306
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:20,471
I was reading her a story
when Helene and Ray come home.

1307
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:21,715
They didn't know I was there.

1308
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:25,225
Stop fucking yelling,
my daughter's sleeping in there.

1309
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:26,810
(ARGUING)

1310
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:29,980
They started talking about how
they'd robbed this drug dealer.

1311
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,149
You know what he's fucking gonna do
if he finds out?

1312
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,984
What's the monkey gonna do?

1313
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:35,402
- Oh, you know...
- I'm not...

1314
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:38,655
And they were talking
about leaving the state.

1315
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,157
So I called Remy and told him.

1316
01:24:40,283 --> 01:24:42,910
There's another drug run
up to Nashua. Taking cocaine...

1317
01:24:42,994 --> 01:24:44,661
And then what?

1318
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:49,500
We took her.

1319
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:55,089
Remy laid out this plan.
It seemed easy.

1320
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:58,008
We take her, force Helene and Ray
to cough up the cash,

1321
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:00,177
then we put her back. You know?

1322
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,262
Amanda gets to spend
a weekend in the country.

1323
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:03,847
My sister learns a lesson.

1324
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:07,017
And fuck it, everybody gets paid
on top of it.

1325
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,020
I got no problem taking money
from a guy like Cheese.

1326
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,688
They were gonna handle the cops.

1327
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,941
But Bea, she went nuts.

1328
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,610
Started calling the papers. Hired you.

1329
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:19,094
Lionel don't want me coming here,
now you don't want the job?

1330
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,033
But once you found the money,
they had Amanda and the money.

1331
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:27,287
So they decided to set up
a fake exchange for you to witness.

1332
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:30,040
They got Chris Mullen
to set up Cheese at the quarry.

1333
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,710
15K and a chance to be the boss.

1334
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:38,799
Cheese figured out
what was happening.

1335
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:42,302
Even though it was too late,
he started shooting.

1336
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,346
Panicking.

1337
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,309
And she just fell. I mean, she just...

1338
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,061
She fell in.

1339
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,148
She's gone.

1340
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,400
It was an accident.
It was just an accident.

1341
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:58,694
She was your sister's kid, Lionel.

1342
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:04,241
- Your sister's child.
- You think I don't miss her?

1343
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,910
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1344
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:12,082
Last summer, Helene and Dottie
took Amanda to the beach.

1345
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:16,420
It was a real hot day.
Amanda fell asleep.

1346
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,339
They left her in the car
while they go off into the dunes,

1347
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:21,175
smoke a doobie with some guys.

1348
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:23,010
Two hours.

1349
01:26:24,762 --> 01:26:27,431
Amanda literally roasted.

1350
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,225
She was three.

1351
01:26:32,937 --> 01:26:37,274
Later on, I was holding her,
trying to help her get to sleep.

1352
01:26:38,276 --> 01:26:42,946
My little Amanda, she was so hot.

1353
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,118
She felt like something
just come out of the oven.

1354
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,788
Like a fucking pot roast.

1355
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,293
So don't feel too sorry for my sister.

1356
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:00,130
Because she never gave a shit
about anyone but herself.

01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,092
Stay with him.

1389
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,239
Drop your gun.

1390
01:29:32,950 --> 01:29:34,659
Put it down!

1391
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:42,918
That bartender wasn't fucking around.

1392
01:29:52,553 --> 01:29:54,096
What did you do?

1393
01:29:54,972 --> 01:29:56,473
Did you get her killed?

1394
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,019
Say yes.

1395
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:07,317
Say yes.

1396
01:30:08,277 --> 01:30:09,736
Say yes!

1397
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:14,825
What're you gonna do? Shoot me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1398
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,668
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1399
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:31,174
She was a child.

1400
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,220
I love children.

1401
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:15,677
Why would I expose a conspiracy
that I was a part of?

1402
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:20,599
I mean, did Lionel contradict
anything I've said?

1403
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:25,061
Did any of the witnesses at the bar
contradict anything I've said?

1404
01:31:25,146 --> 01:31:28,815
A police officer was killed today.
That's not looked on lightly.

1405
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,067
Is corruption looked on lightly?

1406
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,819
Is a little girl getting killed
looked on lightly?

1407
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,112
OFFICER: Whoa, hold on.

1408
01:31:34,197 --> 01:31:36,615
You charge people money
as a detective.

1409
01:31:36,699 --> 01:31:40,619
Now, you're at the quarry
the other night, right?

1410
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,622
And you have no idea
that this is a setup?

1411
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:46,082
You're baffled. Right?

1412
01:31:47,627 --> 01:31:52,088
No, because, strange as it might seem,

1413
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:55,425
I believe the police
when they tell me something.

1414
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:57,344
You're a fresh prick. You know that?

1415
01:31:57,428 --> 01:31:59,638
And because I had a ransom note
and Amanda McCready's blanket

1416
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:00,805
put in my mailbox.

1417
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,934
And because I read a transcript of
a call that Cheese put into the station.

1418
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,101
A 911 call?

1419
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:08,230
No, it was a call
Cheese made to the station.

1420
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:09,606
To Remy Bressant at the station.

1421
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,733
Or that Chris Mullen made,
pretending to be Cheese.

1422
01:32:11,817 --> 01:32:13,610
Or whatever the fuck it was,
but it was recorded,

1423
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:15,570
and there was a call.

1424
01:32:15,655 --> 01:32:17,572
We don't record calls
coming into the station,

1425
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,450
and we don't do transcripts, smart guy.

1426
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:25,121
OFFICER: So, did you hear a tape?

1427
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:28,792
- No, I didn't hear a tape.
- Okay.

1428
01:32:28,876 --> 01:32:31,086
Did you see a transcript?

1429
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:38,385
No, I must've remembered it wrong.

1430
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,105
Kids forgive.

1431
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,648
What do they get for it?

1432
01:32:51,732 --> 01:32:54,150
Amanda literally roasted.

1433
01:33:03,494 --> 01:33:04,661
LIONEL: You think I don't miss her.

1434
01:33:04,745 --> 01:33:07,163
She was more my kid than Helene's.

1435
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:09,374
I love children.

1436
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:18,133
This is the kind of thing that if you do,
Patrick, you wanna be sure.

1437
01:33:20,386 --> 01:33:22,137
Are you sure?

1438
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:24,222
No.

1439
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,936
Are you coming?

1440
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:31,855
No.

1441
01:33:43,576 --> 01:33:46,244
DEVIN: Doyle brought Remy
from Louisiana back in '72.

1442
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:49,039
JACK: Care to read
the highlighted portion?

1443
01:34:00,718 --> 01:34:03,053
Taking a trip?

1444
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:04,888
Patrick Kenzie.

1445
01:34:06,474 --> 01:34:09,267
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1446
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:11,978
Remy Bressant died last night.

1447
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,565
I was told. It's a shame.

1448
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:21,571
Yeah, it's hard to understand.
Because he seemed like a good man.

1449
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,490
He was a good man.

1450
01:34:24,825 --> 01:34:27,494
We don't know
why people do what they do.

1451
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:30,163
Everybody looks out his own window.

1452
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:32,540
And everyone's got their reasons.

1453
01:34:34,543 --> 01:34:36,086
(DOOR OPENS)

1454
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:44,678
- Hey.
- Hi.

1455
01:34:44,762 --> 01:34:46,054
- How are you?
- Good.

1456
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:48,181
REMY: Nick! They're firing at me.

1457
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:49,933
Nick, you hear me? You okay?
They're firing at me!

1458
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:51,184
NICK: Remy!

1459
01:34:51,268 --> 01:34:53,520
- I heard something go in the water!
- Ambush! Ambush!

1460
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:56,481
- Something went in!
- Run. Remy. Run!

1461
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:58,566
LIONEL: Panicking.

1462
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,444
Amanda got scared.
She started running.

1463
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,447
She just fell. I mean, she just fell in.

1464
01:35:08,911 --> 01:35:10,078
WOMAN ON TV: Twenty-nine-year-old
Chris Mullen

1465
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:11,579
was gunned down last night

1466
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:12,914
in an apparent robbery.

1467
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:16,084
You go back inside with Frannie.
Papa will come in soon.

1468
01:35:16,168 --> 01:35:17,335
Make you a sandwich, okay?

1469
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:18,628
- All right.
- That's my girl.

1470
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:19,754
REMY: Don't go down there.

1471
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,506
If I think he has the evidence,
I'll take the hit.

1472
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:22,716
I got no problem doing the time.

1473
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,218
Fuck up, and it's Amanda and her life.

1474
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:26,594
JACK: All right.
LIONEL: I got things to protect, too.

1475
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,930
REMY: You leave that house,
you're an enemy to me

1476
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,223
and you're a danger to Amanda.

1477
01:35:30,307 --> 01:35:32,434
Please, I told him
we took her for ransom. I did it.

1478
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,561
I told him. Remy, please.

1479
01:35:34,645 --> 01:35:35,937
(GUN FIRING)

1480
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,942
So now you know.

1481
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:44,320
LIONEL: My sister's not stable.
She's on crack.

1482
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,489
She's talking about leaving the state.
I'm scared for my niece.

1483
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,783
- Who's gonna take care of her?
- We'll do something.

1484
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:50,952
REMY: We'll figure it out.
She's an addict.

1485
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:52,620
Bigot. Drug mule.

1486
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,749
The child will be dead
or on the street in 10 years.

1487
01:35:55,833 --> 01:35:58,460
JACK: What about the uncle?
REMY: He can never tell anyone.

1488
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:01,963
Not even his wife.
Or he'll never see her again.

1489
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:06,009
It's worth it to him.
Know she'll have a better life.

1490
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:09,095
Do one last good thing
before we hang it up.

1491
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,933
JACK: How many children
have we seen destroyed?

1492
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,186
REMY: Enough.

1493
01:36:18,022 --> 01:36:19,856
Does it make you feel better?

1494
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:24,027
Telling yourself you did it
for the right reasons?

1495
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,446
That you took her to be saved.

1496
01:36:26,530 --> 01:36:28,364
From her own mother?

1497
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:33,745
We're just trying to give
a little girl a life.

1498
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,333
Wasn't your life to give.
Helene's her mother.

1499
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:41,127
If you thought she was a bad mother,
you should've gone to Social Services.

1500
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:45,131
Short of that, she's her mother,
and that's where she belongs.

1501
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:48,551
You turn around.

1502
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,889
You go back to your fucking car,
and you wait 30 years.

1503
01:36:54,308 --> 01:36:56,810
You don't know
what the world is made of yet.

1504
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:02,190
I'm calling state police in five minutes.
They'll be here in ten.

1505
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:05,068
Thought you would've
done that by now.

1506
01:37:07,404 --> 01:37:09,572
You know why you haven't?

1507
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,411
Because you think
this might be an irreparable mistake.

1508
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:20,166
Because deep inside you, you know
it doesn't matter what the rules say.

1509
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,293
When the lights go out
and you ask yourself,

1510
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:26,256
"Is she better off here or better off
there," you know the answer.

1511
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:28,341
And you always will.

1512
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:35,265
You... You could do a right thing here.

1513
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,100
A good thing.

1514
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,228
Men live their whole lives
without getting this chance.

1515
01:37:40,312 --> 01:37:42,188
You walk away from it,

1516
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,566
you may not regret it
when you get home.

1517
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:45,984
You may not regret it for a year,

1518
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,779
but when you get to where I am,
I promise you, you will.

1519
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,951
I'll be dead, you'll be old. But she...

1520
01:37:56,120 --> 01:38:00,290
She'll be dragging around a couple of
tattered, damaged children of her own,

1521
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:04,836
and you'll be the one
who has to tell them you're sorry.

1522
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:08,047
You know what? Maybe that'll happen.

1523
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:12,302
And if it does, I'll tell them I'm sorry,
and I'll live with it.

1524
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,806
But what's never gonna happen
and what I'm not gonna do

1525
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:18,600
is have to apologise
to a grown woman

1526
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:19,767
who comes to me and says,

1527
01:38:19,852 --> 01:38:21,936
"I was kidnapped
when I was a little girl,

1528
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:24,230
"and my aunt hired you to find me.

1529
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:27,859
"And you did, you found me
with some strange family.

1530
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:30,737
"But you broke your promise
and you left me there.

1531
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:33,656
"Why? Why didn't you bring me home?

1532
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:38,661
"Because all the snacks and the outfits
and the family trips don't matter.

1533
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:42,916
"They stole me.

1534
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,711
"It wasn't my family
and you knew about it

1535
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:50,006
"and you knew better
and you did nothing."

1536
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:53,259
And maybe that grown woman
will forgive me,

1537
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,845
but I'll never forgive myself.

1538
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:04,687
I did what I did for the sake of the child.

1539
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:10,026
All right. For me, too.

1540
01:39:12,696 --> 01:39:17,951
But now, I'm asking you
