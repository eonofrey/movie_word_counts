1
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,352
- Hey.
- What's going on?

2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,954
He's definitely in there.
He ain't openin' the door.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,190
- You hopped up?
- Absolutely.

4
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,233
Harrold?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,157
Harrold!

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,356
Hey, buddy, I wanna talk to you!
Open the door!

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,918
I hear him in there.

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,350
Harrold!
Take your weapons out.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,791
Last chance, Harrold!

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,790
Fuck.

11
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,594
Fuckin'...

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,874
Ahh!

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,678
Shit.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,718
Harrold! Harrold?

15
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,834
- Fuck! Fuck you!
- Fucking kidding me!

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,911
You fucking guys
can't kick the fuckin' door?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,736
- Harrold, get some clothes on!
- I got my hands up.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,496
- Don't fucking shoot me!
- Shut up! Hey!

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,920
What the fuck are you doin'?
You guys gonna just stand there?

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,910
Go in there and get him!
Put some clothes on him!

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,310
I fuckin' didn't do nothin'!

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,276
Fuck did I kick that fuckin' door?

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,118
- Hey, Commish.
- Chris.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,514
Third floor upstairs.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,160
- Third?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,816
- What happened with "Shan-creek-a"?
- I was just goin' over there

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,990
to have an appointment
with this female,

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,435
and this lady came out of nowhere

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,115
- and brained me with a smoothie.
- Her daughter says you pushed her.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,156
Sir, I was tryin' to make an escape...

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,800
- Did you push her?
- After the smoothie.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,518
- So you did...
- What's up, Tommy.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,637
Whoa! This is an occasion.
Commish exitin' the SUV?

34
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,109
- Is this a homicide?
- It's not. You've been misinformed.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,856
You're fuckin' kiddin' me.
It's not a homicide?

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,553
- Nope.
- No, sir. No, sir.

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,216
- Why are you bleeding?
- I was trying to tell your officers, sir.

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,753
This woman is crazy.

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,274
And she hit me with a fuckin'
smoothie in the head.

40
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,136
What are you talkin' about?
Like, a drink or somethin'?

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,390
No, like a fuckin' smoothie,
you know?

42
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,675
Like you would smooth
your clothes out with.

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,830
- An iron? A fuckin' iron?
- An iron!

44
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,990
- For fuck's sake!
- It's called an iron, Harrold.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,832
- Yes, sir, a smoothie.
- Shut up.

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,872
Commish, I should be
a captain or a deputy-super

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,216
or probably even your job by now.

48
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,753
I can't take much more of this shit.

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,029
You dug that hole.

50
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,759
You know,
my fuckin' knee is killin' me.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,816
He kicked the fuckin' teeth
out of a vice cop in Back Bay.

52
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,856
How do you fuck your knee up
kickin' a guy in the mouth?

53
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,279
I over-kicked.
I hyper-extended it.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,955
- I thought he fuckin' got suspended.
- Hey! I fuckin' hear you, numb-nuts.

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,190
- Sorry, that's what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,468
- I heard that you got suspended.
- Do I look suspended?

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,949
- No, sir.
- He doesn't look suspended.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,000
Would I be sittin' here starin' at you two
chowderheads if I was suspended?

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,152
No, I wouldn't.
Life is a rigged fucking game.

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,754
You two just passed "Go."
Buckle it the fuck up.

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,195
- Harrold, you're under arrest.
- Actually accurate.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,431
You go home, put some ice
on that knee, and get some sleep.

63
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,193
- Got the race in five hours.
- Catchin' drunks at the marathon.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,317
Boss, please, don't make me
wear the clown suit.

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,391
It's the last hoop, Tommy.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,075
You walk your beat, smile,
and you're officially out of the doghouse.

67
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,673
One more day.

68
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,070
Weather's gonna be nice, pretty girls,
fresh air, be like a big picnic.

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,038
Everybody loves a picnic.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,672
- Pizza delivery for Patrick.
- Hey, baby.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,394
Hey.
How was work?

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,835
This sweet old man came in
and gave that to me today.

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,238
Mr. Flanagan.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,993
His wife was on my floor
a couple months back.

75
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,878
Stage four, so we were just
there to keep her comfortable.

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,270
I guess before she passed,
she told him she wanted me to have it.

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,510
- Huh.
- I hardly knew them,

78
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,990
but he was so sweet and so sad,

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,550
and I was just holding him
and hugging him.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,910
Look at how pretty that is.

81
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,279
Isn't that beautiful?

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,871
And you made me dinner?

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,030
- How's your dissertation coming?
- Huh!

84
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,111
- Two paragraphs, both deleted.
- Uh-huh.

85
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,357
And, uh, but I did tag some cool
apartments in San Francisco to show you.

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,714
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,075
- Look at you, so excited.
- Well, I'm really excited

88
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,832
that we're taking
the day off tomorrow.

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,230
- Mmm.
- And I think after my masterpiece pizza,

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,629
we're gonna have to go
on a run at some point.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,119
- Tomorrow? No, honey.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,080
There's three things
you can do on Patriots Day.

93
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,216
One's watch the marathon,
the other one's run the marathon,

94
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,232
and the third one is get down to Fenway
and yell for those Red Sox.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,197
- Yellin' for the Red Sox.
- Sox.

96
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,748
- Sox.
- Mmm. Red "Sahx."

97
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,035
- Red "Sahx."
- Red "Sahx."

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
- There you go.
- I think you just wanna stay

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,273
in bed with me all day.

100
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,952
- Wanna know what I think?
- Mmm.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,555
I think the reason Mrs. Flanagan
wanted you to have it

102
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,871
was because she knew you would
hold him when he gave it to you.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,639
You're a very sweet man.

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,393
I know. Cheers.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,438
To the Red Sox.

106
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,671
Yeah. "Sahx."

107
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,518
- Sox.
- "Sahx."

108
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,079
"Sahx."

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,231
Did you change
the software and shit?

110
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
All right, let's see.

111
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,068
Uh, yeah. Got it.

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,399
Yes!

113
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,600
- Hey, Li. What's up, guys?
- Oh, hey, Sean, what's up?

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,711
Wow!
What are you feedin' that thing?

115
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,109
It looks like he could
outrun the squad car.

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,031
- She definitely could.
- Look at this!

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,235
- Can I touch it?
- No.

118
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,112
No. No.

119
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,749
So what about
the Zac cowboy concert?

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,637
- Zac Brown Band, yeah.
- Yeah.

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah, I'll get ten tickets.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,872
Hey, it's gonna be
a cultural experience, okay?

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,554
You're gonna get
a better education than MIT,

124
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,596
Harvard, BU, BC.

125
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,671
I need everybody's hat sizes,
we'll all get hats.

126
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,816
- Yeah, cool.
- Get right.

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,115
- All right, boys.
- Thanks.

128
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,275
Well, listen, you know
I like my chicken fried,

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,272
- a cold beer on a Friday night...
- Me, too.

130
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,271
...and my jeans that fit too tight.

131
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,954
- Just right. Your jeans, just right.
- Just right. Just right.

132
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,399
Do you think you'll definitely come?

133
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,751
- Or...
- Yes. I will be there.

134
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,037
Okay. Cool. Yeah.

135
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,989
Oh, Tommy!

136
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,616
I'm sorry. I just gotta
get my clothes for tomorrow.

137
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,757
Tommy, oh, my God.
Get the fuck out of my room.

138
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,908
- But this is our room.
- You know, now I can officially

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,436
tell your blood alcohol by the frequency
of key scratches on the lock.

140
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,438
- It's a predictive pattern, Tommy.
- I had two pops, okay?

141
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,273
It's medicinal.
And I got roll call...

142
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,456
- You sound like...
- ...in four hours and 42 minutes.

143
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,516
- ...elephant.
- I'm sorry. All right?

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,456
Please, come on, just go.
I'll see you in the morning.

145
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,357
Hey... want me
to cuddle with you?

146
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,317
- No! I told you to leave, Tommy.
- Come on.

147
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,994
- I love you.
- I love you.

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,998
- Go on. You're wakin' me up.
- I'm sorry. All right?

149
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,389
- Okay. Quit ya' talkin'.
- Go back to sleep.

150
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,871
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, bye.

151
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,915
You wanna go get your drink?

152
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,995
One on top?
You thirsty?

153
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,836
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

154
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,473
What do you want?
Juice? Milk?

155
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,916
Mommy, Mommy, open.

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,914
Here you go, baby.

157
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,678
Let's go in the room.

158
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,793
Uniform's dry.

159
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,314
I also swapped out the battery
in your shoulder mic.

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,835
I haven't seen you
in your uniform for a while.

161
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,956
Yeah, that was on purpose.

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,838
- Oh, God.
- Come on. Let me see it.

163
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,919
- Don't start.
- Mmm. Kinda turns me on.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,072
- Really?
- Gotta get your hair cut first.

165
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,674
It's at the top of my list.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,035
God, I gotta put this thing on.

167
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,558
Do I look like a clown?

168
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,993
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm not.

169
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,536
- I look like a clown.
- No! It's just...

170
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,736
- No, it's okay.
- It's your color.

171
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,400
I'm basically
a crossing guard, all right?

172
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,096
And they send me to the Marathon,
at the finish line

173
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,476
with the biggest VIPs in the city,
and everybody's gonna break my balls.

174
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,233
- You got my whistle and my stop sign?
- Come here. Gimme a kiss.

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,272
- I love you.
- I love you.

176
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,576
I'll see you later on, all right?

177
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,656
- All right.
- I'll see you tonight.

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,749
Don't kick any cops.

179
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,030
- I'll try not to.
- I hear they hate that.

180
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,678
Sweetheart?
You saw me yesterday, right?

181
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,877
- Mm-hmm.
- So, is it just me,

182
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,856
or am I gettin' a little
better lookin' every day?

183
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,395
Why don't you come over here, and I'll
show you how good-lookin' you are?

184
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,871
Boy, I wish I had time for that.

185
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,355
Love you.

186
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,078
What do you want,
a muffin or a bagel?

187
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,549
- Oh, bring me a muffin, please.
- Yes, doll.

188
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,073
- Love you!
- Love you!

189
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,517
- Hey, Tiesha.
- Morning, Sergeant Jeff.

190
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,637
- How's your day today?
- It is a muffin day, sweetheart.

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,792
- We got blueberry.
- Oh. You're an angel.

192
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,792
- I try to be, just for you.
- How's school goin'?

193
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,075
The boys leavin' you alone,
lettin' you study?

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,236
They are.
They have no choice.

195
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,033
In the cup.

196
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,348
- Have a great day.
- You, too.

197
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,160
Right over there,
next to the table.

198
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,000
Are we feeding
that other video or no time to?

199
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,069
Nobody in the VIP section at all.

200
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,151
Unless they have credentials, period,
all right?

201
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,878
Nobody.
Hey, Tommy!

202
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,837
- What's up?
- I got a favor.

203
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,056
It's actually a gift.
I'm gonna give you the finishin' line.

204
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,354
- Come on!
- No, no, no.

205
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,910
This is your welcome back, Tommy.
Means no more fuck-ups.

206
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,275
Just smile in front of all the VIPs

207
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,794
and let 'em all remember
what a great fuckin' guy

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,376
- Tommy Saunders is.
- I understand that.

209
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,816
- Can I just talk to you for a second?
- No, no, no, no.

210
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,936
Look, can't you see the beauty
of just sayin' "Thank you"?

211
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,757
I say, "You're welcome." Huh?

212
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,560
It's just a trade-off
to get your job back.

213
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,551
- Look...
- Nah.

214
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,279
No more words. I just wanna get
to the Hopkinton, all right?

215
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,874
- What time you gonna run?
- Under three, I hope.

216
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,077
That ain't happenin'.
Good luck.

217
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,536
What are you lookin' at?

218
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,073
World's most overpaid meter maid.

219
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,037
Wow.

220
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,429
You wanna move the barricades?
I gotta get to Hopkinton.

221
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,796
Hey! Well, don't stand around.
He told you to move the barricade, not me.

222
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,836
Carol!
I need you to do me a favor.

223
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,399
My knee's gotten swollen fatter.

224
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,153
I gotta have you bring the fatter
knee brace down to me, all right?

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,936
I'm at the finish line,
so you'll be able to find me.

226
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
All right, I love you, baby.
Thanks.

227
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,596
Yeah, but what about, like-like,

228
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,194
Erik and Rafi
and Brendan and those guys?

229
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,016
I mean, those guys were our friends,
so it's like...

230
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,510
Don't think about 'em.
Doesn't matter.

231
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,348
Bro, I'm...
Look, I'm not pussin' out or nothin'.

232
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,796
I'm not at all. I'm just thinkin' about
Martin Luther King, and like...

233
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,678
Martin Luther King
was not a Muslim.

234
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,751
He was a hypocrite.
He was a fornicator.

235
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,314
Yeah, but I'm a fornicator.

236
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,238
You think that's funny?

237
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,030
No.

238
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,838
Come here.

239
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,353
What?

240
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,551
- What?
- You're my brother.

241
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,874
- You understand that?
- Yeah.

242
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,235
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

243
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,936
Good morning, everyone.

244
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,475
It is great to have you with us for
the running of the Boston Marathon.

245
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,120
Round one starts in ten minutes.

246
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,496
We're looking at
a live picture of the start line

247
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,353
in Hopkinton where it all begins
for the runners...

248
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,112
Superintendent Billy Evans

249
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,840
representing
the Boston Police Department.

250
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,720
30 seconds to go. This will...

251
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,230
There is Lelisa Desisa,
who I think is probably the...

252
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,176
In remembrance of the 20 students

253
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,590
and six staff members
who lost their lives,

254
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,398
the Boston Athletic Association

255
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,675
wishes to express
its deepest sympathy

256
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,878
to the families of the victims
of all residents of Newtown.

257
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,678
We ask that you join us in observing

258
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,216
- a period of silence...
- Standby, A.

259
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,595
- ...of 26 seconds.
- Ready, C.

260
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,511
Ready C is up.

261
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,751
Twenty-six, 25, 24,

262
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,229
23, 22,

263
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,754
21, 20,

264
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,991
19, 18,

265
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,959
17, 16, 15,

266
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,953
14, 13, 12,

267
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,316
11, ten, nine,

268
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,836
eight, seven,

269
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,434
six, five...

270
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,475
...4, 3, 2, 1...

271
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,656
And they are off.

272
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,390
The elite men in the 117th running
of the Boston Marathon,

273
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,359
the oldest running marathon
in the United States.

274
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,830
You can see that the crowd
has thickened to about four deep

275
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,559
at some places there along
this course in Hopkinton...

276
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,952
Donohue,
are you on night vision?

277
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,190
Why are you on night vision?
That's atrocious.

278
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,396
And this guy owes me 20 bucks.

279
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,239
Watch your hand, man.
And what do I owe you $20 for again?

280
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,278
- 'Cause I talked to her.
- You didn't talk to her.

281
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,976
Get the fuck outta here.
You talked to her?

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,656
She said she's comin'
to the Zac Brown concert.

283
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,114
- Big mistake.
- Nice MIT girl?

284
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,798
She'll love it.
She'll be smitten.

285
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,394
Gotta take her to something
classy, like the Pops.

286
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,471
- The Pops?
- Yeah, the Pops.

287
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,835
- Name one Pop.
- Beethoven. Done.

288
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,512

303
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,032
through Ashland,
Framingham, Natick...

304

Desisa's to the right of your screen...

...back to the women
for a second, they got about six miles...

306
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,136
The elites have reached mile eight.

00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,388
Expected on Boylston Street...

308
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,471
Paying my debt to society.

309
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,596
- Oh, God...
- In the doghouse, huh?

310
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,715
Yeah, but it's all right.

311
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,256
He says it's the last hoop,
so we'll see.

312
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,456
Get a haircut, though, will ya?

313
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,755
I'll cut my hair once
you stop shaving your legs.

314
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,392
Sorry!
Couldn't find my jacket.

315
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,069
Ready to go?

316
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,151
- Can we grab some drinks before we go?
- Sure.

317
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,470
- Let's get "drunch."
- You don't have to beg me.

318
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,336
...and as all
the contenders are in there,

319
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,616
and they're closing hand over fist.

320
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,949
Kogo, Desisa, and Gabremariam.

321
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,110
So Ethiopia has two of the three.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,752
- Ready, man?
- Yes, Daddy.

323
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,239
- You are?
- Yeah.

324
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,470
- Wanna go see Mommy at the race?
- Yeah!

325
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,960
Wanna go cheer on Mommy
at the race?

326
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,196
Let's roll. Let's roll.

327
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,589
All right.

328
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Yes.

329
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,471
...and running one of
the most famous streets in Boston...

330
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,456
The front-runners are approaching mile 23!

331
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,755
We're mere minutes away
from crowning the winner

332
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,196
- of the 2013 Boston Marathon.
- Get some people outta here.

333
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,016
This is against fire code.
We got way too many people.

334
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,678
- She can stay.
- Thanks, Tommy.

335
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,518
How are you?
How's your husband, good?

336
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,640
He's good.
He's doing fine.

337
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,736
Again, you're looking
at Heartbreak Hill now.

338
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,216
We're leaving the elites now.

339
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,109
Kenmore Square.

340
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,080
You see the light stanchions
over that building.

341
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,069
This is one of the really cool
spots in Boston...

342
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,628
And look at that,
the Boston Marathon running

343
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,518
right past Fenway Park,
which will soon empty out...

344
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,136
...making the right turn,
they're heading up towards Boylston.

345
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,755
Looks like Ethiopia
is gonna reign supreme!

346
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,096
And here they come!

347
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,838
Heading down Boylston
for the last block!

348
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,036
Is there anyone else on the road?

349
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,633
Very fast time.

350
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,075
Standby, camera three..

351
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,355
Three, two, one...

352
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,555
and lead the way.

353
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,473
Desisa is the 2013

354
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,313
champion of the elites.

355
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,281
Time to take in
what the Boston Marathon is truly about.

356
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,111
Watching thousands of amateur athletes
complete the amazing feat.

357
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,629
I'd think about losin'
that Yankees cap.

358
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,600
You got a lot of Sox fans in these bars.
I'd hate to see ya get tuned up.

359
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,074
Oh.

360
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,076
And say hello to Frank Night,
from Boston, Massachusetts.

361
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,919
Thanks.

362
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,911
Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry 'bout that.

363
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,194
Please excuse me.

364
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,590
That's Police Chief
Billy Evans crossing the finish line!

365
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,275
Way to go, Billy!

366
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,952
- Thank you, Governor.
- Nice job.

367
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,518
Does anybody
have a big tub of melted butter?

368
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,717
A huge lobster
just crossed the finish line!

369
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,432
Hey! Leo...

370
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,429
- Time out.
- No time out!

371
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,435
- Hey!
- Baby...

372
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,238
- You behavin' yourself?
- Oh, yeah.

373
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,435
Here it is, you numbskull.

374
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,016
You're on your feet all day,
and you wear the wrong one?

375
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,216
I did it on purpose so you'd have to
bring me the fatter one.

376
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,959
- Romantic, right?
- I'm sure that was your plan!

377
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,520
- You wanna walk with me a bit?
- No, I gotta get back to work!

378
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,960
I gotta claw my way outta this zoo!

379
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,160
- I love you. Thanks for the brace.
- I love you, too.

380
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,395
Hey, give that to Joey.

381
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,599
Looking down Boylston,

382
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,200
you can see waves of runners
turning the corner for the final...

383
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,951
Did you see that guy?

384
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,835
There he is.
General Patton in a neon vest.

385
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,416
Hey, Commish, I'll get a fuckin' smoothie
and be waitin' in the back

386
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,555
of the Tahoe for you and Q.

387
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,471
Hey, grab this bozo!

388
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,915
Get him outta here!
Keep your eyes open, will ya?

389
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,696
I'm proud of ya, Tommy.
How ya feelin'?

390
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,312
The knee hurts.
The back hurts.

391
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,992
The balls hurt.
The pain sometimes feels

392
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,256
like it hurts
on top of the hurt,

393
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,456
if that's even remotely possible.

394
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,675
This is Davis.

395
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,591
No, the Biden call's
scheduled for 3:00.

396
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,456
Biden? Vice President Biden?
Hey, let me talk to him.

397
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,914
- Behave yourself, Tommy.
- Commissioner, let me talk to him!

398
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,558
Guys! The lobster's back!

399
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,517
Come here!
Cuff that lobster, will you?

400
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,754
Whoo!

401
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,559
The finalists
in the wheelchair competition here...

402
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,680
...very fast runners
here out on this storied course.

403
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,278
So much history today.

404
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,033
To all the runners
and our team behind the scenes,

405
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,156
thank you for bringing this race...

406
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,870
Those are bombs, Captain!
Those are bombs!

407
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,840
This is Delta 984!
We got multiple explosions! We need...

408
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Shit!

409
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,470
All medical personnel
to the finish line! Now!

410
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,312
Something just exploded
at the finish line.

411
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,311
What did he say?
Let's turn around, Q.

412
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,791
I repeat, multiple casualties!

413
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
I got you.

414
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,594
Sir, you're gonna be okay, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

415
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,000
Ma'am, hold on to this
as tight as you can.

416
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,076
Hey, get that wheelchair
over here now!

417
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,876
All medical personnel
to the finish line!

418
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,269
- We need two over here!
- Repeat, multiple casualties!

419
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,669
- Tommy!
- Carol!

420
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,911
You okay? Huh? Lemme see.

421
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,874
All right. You're okay. You're okay.
Hey, Sully, come here!

422
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,428
Carol, go with him now!
Get her home now!

423
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,748
Repeat your location!

424
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,751
This is Delta 984!
I'm at the finish line!

425
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,520
I only wanna hear from the 984!

426
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,278
I only wanna hear
from that supervisor.

427
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,536
All right, this is what I need.

428
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,028
I want Ring Road clear,
so I can push ambulances in and out!

429
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,718
Keep pushin' in those ambulances!

430
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,556
Okay. People are coming.

431
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,552
Ma'am, you're on fire.
That's it.

432
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,668
Oh, shit!

433
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,515
Sir?

434
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,989
Can we get some help, sir?
Anyone, sir, please?

435
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah.

436
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,470
You're okay. You're okay.

437
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,834
You're okay.

438
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
We gotta take your son
and get him some help.

439
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,472
Leo! Leo!

440
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,358
You're gonna be okay, sir.

441
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,596
You all right? You hear me?

442
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,480
You're okay.

443
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,915
I can't...

444
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,228
We'll figure this out.

445
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,958
- I'll find you in just a minute.
- Jess...

446
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,839
Get the wheelchairs!
Come on!

447
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,720
Both of her legs
are severely lacerated.

448
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
- On three, ready?
- This is my wife.

449
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,395
She's gonna be okay.

450
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,719
Hey! Send two more ambulances
from Ring Road right now!

451
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,394
This is Sergeant Davis
at the Forum Cafe.

452
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,869
I need personnel at
the second bomb site immediately!

453
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,753
I need assistance!

454
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,558
This is Delta 984.
I'm heading to the second bomb site!

455
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,471
Everybody, keep this line clear!

456
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,758
And stop letting runners through!
Secure the perimeter!

457
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,718
If I see another runner,
your ass is done!

458
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,836
We need a fuckin'
ambulance over here!

459
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
We need ambulances down
at the second bombing site!

460
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,558
Starbucks and the Forum!

461
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,320
Are there more bombs?
Are there more bombs?

462
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,816
No, no, no, no.
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

463
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,976
- You're doin' good, all right?
- What's that? What's that?

464
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,680
Don't look at that!
Look at me! Look at me!

465
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,159
Get that over here now!

466
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,674
Guys, shut down the race!

467
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,513
Do not have another person
run down Boylston Street!

468
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,795
Come on, get her up, get her up!
Shut down the race!

469
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,348
Fuck, Tommy!
We've got two fatalities.

470
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,159
We got two fatalities,
and a fuckin' kid, eight years old.

471
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,336
- Where's his family?
- They're wounded.

472
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,656
They fuckin' dragged
everybody out.

473
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,816
- For fuck's sake, what do we do?
- I don't fuckin' know.

474
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,056
We gotta leave someone with him.
We cannot leave him here alone, Captain.

475
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,216
No, we're gonna get
someone by his side.

476
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,376
- I ain't goin anywhere.
- We need everybody

477
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,496
out of the area immediately.

478
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,936
We gotta clear the perimeter.
Could be more bombs.

479
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Yeah, I'm on it.

480
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,440
Hey!

481
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,991
Anyone in here? Anyone?

482
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,119
Shit!

483
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,509
This is Delta 984.
We gotta confiscate all cell phones.

484
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,720
Repeat. If you see anyone recordin',
grab their phones, I don't care who it is!

485
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,789
They gotta find my boy.

486
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,189
Somebody, please...

487
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,838
Don't worry.
We'll find him, sir.

488
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,439
I don't know where he is.

489
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,216
Lee, I'm James. I'm going to
take care of you, all right?

490
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,309
You're going to be fine.

491
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,794
Can you feel that?
Can you wiggle your toes?

492
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,631
Good. Good, good, good.
We're good.

493
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,280
We're gonna save your leg, okay?

494
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,390
Hey, you gotta help me
find my son.

495
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,517
His name is Leo Woolfenden.
He's three years old.

496
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,511
We got separated somehow.
Somebody took him.

497
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,636
I just didn't...
You need to find him.

498
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,032
His name is Leo Woolfenden.
W-O-O-L...

499
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,736
Push out and make sure
we're keepin' people out of the perimeter.

500
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,593
- All right? Get moving.
- We've got a six-block perimeter set up.

501
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,035
We're all locked down here.

502
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,998
Oh, boy.
Here we go. Here we go.

503
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,397
- This is the first blast scene?
- Yeah.

504
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,976
The second was down there
at the Forum restaurant.

505
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,416
- Total station en route.
- Okay, we need TEDAC and OPU.

506
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,096
- What about cell phones, cameras?
- Yeah, we're right on top of that.

507
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,776
Yeah, we're collecting cell phones,
surveillance tapes,

508
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,296
- all the video we can find.
- Get 'em all, Tommy. Don't miss any.

509
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,456
How big is the secured perimeter?

510
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,856
Six blocks off the course
each direction.

511
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,030
- Let's extend that. Make it 10.
- You got it.

512
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,136
It's clearly coordinated.
There could be more bombs.

513
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:40,277
- How many total wounded?
- Got three fatalities that we know of.

514
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,954
One's a little child on the street
in front of the Forum.

515
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,793
What are they doin'?

516
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,856
What? I said that's
an eight-year-old kid under there.

517
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,536
No, they can't move the body.
We've gotta clear them out.

518
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,616
Tell them to clear out of there!

519
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,896
- You got it, you got it.
- Tell them to clear out of there.

520
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,416
- Who the fuck are you?
- Sorry, Sergeant.

521
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,591
Could be clues in the blood-splattered
bomb residue on the boy's body.

522
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,352
We can't risk moving him.
Nothing moves.

523
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,336
What's the matter with you guys?
You gonna tell that boy's parents

524
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,216
that their son's still
lyin' on the fuckin' street?

525
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,696
- Turn it down, Tommy.
- Oh, fuck that!

526
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,950
- Tommy! Let's go over there.
- All right, Billy...

527
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,520
Just fuckin' leave me alone,
will ya?

528
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,473
We've gotta decide who's running this,
and we have to decide quickly.

529
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,391
If it's terrorism,
it's yours, Rick.

530
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,711
Gentlemen, the moment we label
this terrorism, everything changes.

531
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,718
It's not about Boston anymore.
It's not a local investigation.

532
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,109
It's Wolf Blitzer.
It's stock markets.

533
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,990
It's politicians and knee-jerk reactions,
anti-Muslim backlash...

534
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,399
And what if we're wrong?

535
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,656
I mean, there's no take-back.
I've been through this before.

536
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,750
Look, your call,
but we already know it is.

537
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,229
And a cell is activated,
they hit Chicago or New York

538
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,839
or Washington,
what happens then?

539
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,388
The accusations are gonna come,
no matter what we do.

540
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,515
It's terrorism.
We'll take it.

541
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,111
So, what do you need?

542
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,117
Command center.
Really big one.

543
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,792
This'll do.

544
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,471
I want CART team over there.

545
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,835
Post-blast investigators
in that corner.

546
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,592
We need a media tent set up.

547
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,160
All right, let's get an evidence grid

548
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,231
started right over there
against that wall.

549
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,595
And I guarantee
these are gonna crash,

550
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,910
so let's get a bank of
landlines up immediately.

551
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,752
We're good, boss.
We'll be up in an hour.

552
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,896
Commissioner Davis,
the "New York Post" is reporting

553
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,673
a 20-year-old Saudi national
has been charged.

554
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,432
- Can you confirm?
- That is false.

555
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,750
We have not charged
anyone at this time.

556
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,230
We are asking the public to help us
supplement the investigation.

557
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,914
Anyone with photos
or video of the marathon

558
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,639
is encouraged to turn them in
to Boston Police.

559
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,736
I need you to give me access
to the following databases...

560
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,159
Travel, Visa...

561
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,536
Someone needs to get on the phone
with the United States Attorney's office.

562
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,869
Get us some warrants for
the cell phone towers right now.

563
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,316
AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile,
all the way down the track.

564
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,517
Let T actical Aviation know, as of right
now, Boston owns both those planes.

565
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,518
Get them both to Logan.
No, I'm talkin' about the T-5's.

566
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,313
They're gonna be cycling from
Logan to Quantico. That's it.

567
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,920
FBI servers just got 12,000
e-mails in under a minute.

568
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,115
Holy Christ.

569
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,112
And we're crashed.
Get us back online now.

570
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,560
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Now.

571
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
28-year-old female,
Jessica Kensky.

572
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,474
- Pulse, 101.
- BP's 84 over 45.

573
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,216
Think the best
that we could do is a BKA.

574
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,550
The soft tissue's also compromised.
I don't think this is salvageable.

575
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,456
There's way
too much soft tissue damage.

576
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
We gotta take it.
There's nothin' left here.

577
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,376
I need some saline.
We need to wipe off this flap.

578
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,616
Male, late 20s with no ID.

579
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,160
The leg is not looking good.

580
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,710
All right, the vessels are controlled,
but there is no viability here.

581
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,950
Absolutely no blood supply.
We'll have to amputate.

582
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,155
Saw.

583
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,876
Amputating below the knee, left leg.

584
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,672
We're recreating the scene.

585
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,194
Put every item down
exactly where it was found.

586
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
We need this spread out here.

587
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,712
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Lay some paper down.

588
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Let the stuff air dry.
I don't want to degrade the DNA.

589
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,033
Carol? Pick up the phone!
Carol, can you hear me?

590
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,600
Get this paper over here.

591
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,389
If you come across any clothing
that's burnt or charred, separate that.

592
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,520
I need to have somebody collect these
cell phones here, get 'em down to CART.

593
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,696
Okay, people, remember,

594
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,976
- the bombs had to be carried in somehow.
- Carol, you gotta call me back

595
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,416
as soon as you get
this message, all right?

596
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,477
...on large bags and/or backpacks.

597
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,536
Sort these out by adapter types.

598
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,552
Anything with a camera, we need
to get over to the import station.

599
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,600
Are those GPS tags
comin' through okay?

600
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,908
Yes, sir.

601
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,036
All right.
Yeah, I got him right here.

602
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,030
JFK Library's not an explosion.

603
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,754
Hello? Oh, Carol!
I've been calling and calling!

604
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,432
Tommy, Jesus.
Are you okay?

605
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,909
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
You're not hurt, are ya?

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,638
I'm fine, Tommy.
My mother's here.

607
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,976
- Everybody's here.
- Oh, thank God!

608
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,069
The news is going crazy.

609
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,576
They're sayin'
there could be more bombs.

610
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,195
- Please be careful, Tommy.
- I will. I gotta go, all right?

611
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,714
I'm gonna call you
as soon as I can.

612
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,869
I love you.

613
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,675
Hey, Sarge, heard you on the radio
this afternoon. Hell of a job.

614
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,776
I thought I heard your
squeaky-ass voice in my ear.

615
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,976
Don't fuck around right now,
Mike, please?

616
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,440
I'm not fuckin' around.
You did good.

617
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,919
Hey, honey, it's me.

618
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,955
Sweetheart,
I've got out one day too late.

619
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,310
I will. No.

620
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,237
I love you, too.

621
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,456
What are those guys doin' here?
They weren't even down there!

622
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,536
What the fuck is this, a joke?

623
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,096
They're the FBI and they're in charge,
Tommy, so just do as you're told.

624
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,951
And their boss,
I wouldn't wanna be that guy.

625
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,190
He's triple-fucked.
One, he steps up and takes it.

626
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,056
- Two, now he's gotta solve the thing.
- What's three?

627
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,856
He's gotta walk around
inside that life all day long.

628
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,480
- Fuckin' shoot me four times and...
- Button it up, Tommy.

629
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,896
These young guys
are lookin' up to you.

630
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,558
I don't need the ass-ache
from you today.

631
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,471
- Just do as you're fuckin' told!
- Fine.

632
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,233
We have no evidence
this was a suicide attack.

633
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,232
So these IED's were most likely
remotely detonated.

634
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,914
It is highly probable
these bombs were homemade.

635
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,833
It is likely that they made more.

636
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,990
What does Mass State think?

637
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,296
I think we need to get air assets
from the National Guard.

638
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,216
I think we need a couple
additional tactical teams.

639
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,992
But most importantly,
there's two bathrooms

640
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,911
in this place,
and one's broken.

641
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,115
Right, I'll get on to that.

642
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,193
It is safe to say that we're dealing
with more than one individual,

643
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,317
- some degree of sophistication.
- Excuse me, Agent Deh-law-ray?

644
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,656
- Special Agent DesLauriers.
- Sorry about that.

645
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,696
- Look, I just wanted to say...
- It's not the time or place.

646
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,472
I just want to say,
I work Homicide.

647
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,790
I know one thing closes cases...
witnesses.

648
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,520
So we oughta get our asses
to the hospital, interview the victims.

649
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,993
Could be someone
saw somethin', no?

650
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,513
Tommy, get some of
our guys on this.

651
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,990
And keep in mind that the bomber
could be among the wounded.

652
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,115
We've seen it before.

653
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,953
So let's get positive lD's on everybody
comin' into the hospital.

654
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,976
Let's show this cocksucker
he messed with the wrong fuckin' city.

655
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,136
We're getting
conflicting reports about the arrest

656
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,798
of a Saudi national earlier.

657
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,871
Now, Commissioner Davis
at this time is insisting

658
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,996
that no suspects
have been arrested.

659
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,311
Dzhokhar! I asked you
to get whole milk. This is two percent.

660
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,600
It's milk. She's a baby.
She can't taste the difference.

661
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
No, she can't,
but I will when she gets sick.

662
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,416
Feed the baby in the bedroom.
I can't hear the news.

663
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,616
What am I supposed to give her?

664
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,176
- This isn't gonna work.
- Feed the baby in the bedroom.

665
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,336
- I can't hear...
- I needed whole milk!

666
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,238
I'll take care of it! Feed her
in the bedroom right now! Go!

667
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,392
Make him get whole milk.

668
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,736
We shouldn't have put
the bombs ground level.

669
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,671
We shoulda
put that shit waist-high.

670
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,910
- Go get the right milk, Dzhokhar. Go!
- What? No.

671
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,640
I don't wanna hear any more of
her bullshit. Go get the right milk.

672
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,656
Mind if I ask you
a couple of questions?

673
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,136
Did you see anything
out of the ordinary?

674
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,216
- Anything suspicious?
- Nah.

675
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,310
Did you see anybody
put bags down or...

676
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,472
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

677
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,750
Has anybody spoken
to you guys yet?

678
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,512
No? What's your name, sweetie?

679
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,576
My knee's killing me.
You got some Tylenol back there?

680
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,536
We got all kinds of stuff, Sergeant.
You want a Vicodin?

681
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,816
- No, no Vicodin. Tylenol.
- Tylenol, Tylenol.

682
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,760
- Make it four pills, please.
- Okay, you got it.

683
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Thank you.

684
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,790
Hey, do we have a name on him yet?

685
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,673
No, the EMT said he was
with his wife at the site.

686
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,831
But all I've got is this ring.

687
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,151
It's engraved
"PB and J. 8-25-12."

688
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,715
- She's gotta be in a different hospital.
- Let me call around.

689
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:32,256
They are still keeping people
out of this area, obviously.

690
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,477
Still that 15-block area
that was mentioned earlier.

691
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,156
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

692
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,789
- It's fried rice? Eggroll?
- Yeah. Everything's in there.

693
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,518
Okay.

694
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,436
It's a very scary day today.

695
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,237
My name is Danny.
What was your name?

696
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,548
My name's Kara.

697
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,676
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

698
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,070
- Are you from Boston?
- Yeah, I live here.

699
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,913
Oh, I live in Cambridge.

700
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,389
- Oh, that's not far.
- No.

701
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,256
The FBI
has taken over the criminal investigation

702
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,508
into the bombings.

703
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,353
The Bureau is asking you
for any visual...

704
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,032
- Hey, John.
- Hey, what's up?

705
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,588
- This fucking bombing, huh?
- Awful.

706
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,796
- Are we gonna supplement this?
- Not that I know of.

707
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,189
It's all BPD.

708
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,271
- What do you got?
- Everything's busted.

709
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,588
The radio bracket's loose.

710
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,736
The right window goes down
when I put on the blinker.

711
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,955
Tell me this thing
about the blinker?

712
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,759
Yeah, it goes down,
but only when I signal right.

713
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,216
'Course, the big question this morning...

714
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,435
- Who did this?
- That is fuckin' weird.

715
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,078
And why did they do this?

716
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,237
Excuse me. Sir?
Sorry to disturb you.

717
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,595
- Is this Jessica Kensky?
- Yes. She's my daughter.

718
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,992
Hey, I understand.

719
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,816
- I can come back, okay?
- No, that's... Sorry.

720
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,353
How can we help you?

721
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,431
I just wanna know
if she said anything at all?

722
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,636
- If she communicated anything?
- Not much.

723
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,475
She just asked
about her husband.

724
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,473
We don't know where he is.
His name is Patrick Downes.

725
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,030
- Can you help us find him?
- You leave that to us, okay?

726
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,350
- Okay?
- Thank you.

727
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,191
My God. Oh...

728
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,158
- Hey.
- What are you guys doin' here?

729
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,016
What the fuck happened out there?
What's goin' on?

730
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,634
Is this fuckin' Al-Qaeda or what?
Was it Al-Qaeda?

731
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,472
Are you fuckin' eating
Cheerios on my couch?

732
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,576
- Hey, Tommy...
- Who did it? What are they sayin'?

733
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,349
What happened?
Listen, was it Al-Qaeda or what?

734
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,991
We're gonna give him
some space, all right?

735
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,355
Does someone wanna tell us
what the hell happened?

736
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,432
Get everybody outta here. Get the...
get the fuck outta here now!

737
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,034
- Every fuckin' one of you!
- Come on! What the hell did I do?

738
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,758
What do you mean?
Fuckin' come on!

739
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,637
- Sorry!
- Get the fuck outta here!

740
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,200
Whatever you want, Tommy.
Whatever you need, whatever you need.

741
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,870
Blue coat.

742
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,112
I've got a street-block radius.

743
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,438
Yeah, it's a little grainy.

744
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,353
Time doesn't match it.

745
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,111
You got 'em?

746
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,389
I don't... I don't know.

747
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,511
It's okay, baby.

748
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,155
I don't even understand what I saw.

749
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,393
I keep seein' this blood.
It's, like, everywhere.

750
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,038
I saw a foot next to...

751
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,472
This boy from...
Well, I think from Marathon Sport.

752
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,109
He looked like a little BU kid.
Like a good kid, Carol, you know?

753
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,038
He had an assistant manager tag

754
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,236
and, um...

755
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,629
he helped, we moved her.

756
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,558
We... we laid her down.

757
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,960
Blood just started to spread,
his knee was in her blood...

758
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,671
And then there was
an eight-year-old boy.

759
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,069
He was just layin' there.

760
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,914
They had to take his family away,
and his parents, and fuck, he's fuckin'...

761
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,430
I got these images in my head.

762
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,034
They ain't goin' away.

763
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,588
And you were right there.

764
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,953
Please don't be mad at me
that I told you to come down there.

765
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,951
I shouldn't have told you
to come down there.

766
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,918
You never could have known.
Baby, it's not your fault.

767
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,150
I'm sorry, Carol.

768
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,913
I'm sorry that I told you to come.

769
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,991
I'm sorry that I put you there.

770
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,120
We gotta find
these motherfuckers, Carol.

771
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,355
We gotta get out there
and find these motherfuckers

772
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,919
before they do this
to somebody else.

773
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,353
Back it up three seconds.

774
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,435
Boss!

775
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,876
This guy. White hat.

776
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,113
Play it again.

777
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,435
He's the only one that looks away.

778
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,711
Feds wanna talk to you.
Rick. Sergeant Saunders.

779
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,111
Thank you for coming so quickly.

780
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,918
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

781
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,877
Ed tells me you're familiar
with this area?

782
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,473
Yeah, why?

783
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,474
- Let's run it.
- White Hat.

784
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,109
Play it back.

785
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,912
The guy right there
with the white hat?

786
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,232
- That's the guy, isn't it?
- We believe so.

787
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,958
It's gotta be.

788
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,793
Okay, so I am White Hat.

789
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,871
At exactly 2:45,

790
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,556
I am seen by the surveillance videos
outside the Forum restaurant, okay?

791
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,428
Now, Sergeant, as you can see, we've
recreated the Boylston Street crime scene.

792
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,916
Now, let's move left of boom.

793
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,671
Left of what?

794
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,558
Left of boom.
Left of the explosions.

795
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,474
We need to trace him backwards.
You know this street, right?

796
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,869
And you know which places
have security cameras?

797
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,336
Yeah, yeah.
I know what you're doin'.

798
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,954
That's the finish line there.
You said 2:45?

799
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,553
Correct.

800
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,632
All right, so where is he at 2:44?
Who can see him?

801
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,438
- It's gotta be Crate & Barrel.
- Crate & Barrel, anybody?

802
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,158
Checking Crate & Barrel.

803
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,799
Yes, sir!

804
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,835
I see you. 2:44 p.m.

805
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,037
The hat's got a golf logo along
with the number three.

806
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,351
Okay. I wanna find every store
in Boston that's selling that hat.

807
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,816
Pull the names from
the credit card receipts...

808
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Crate & Barrel.

809
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,576
...then cross-check it
against facial recognitions.

810
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,195
Okay, Sergeant.
I'm Crate & Barrel at 2:44.

811
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,793
Who sees me now?

812
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,713
It's the Walgreen's
that's across the street now.

813
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,314
- Abe 'n Louie's?
- Abe 'n Louie?

814
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,800
Checking Abe 'n Louie's.

815
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,833
- Anybody got Abe 'n Louie?
- Nothing, sir.

816
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,876
- No?
- No, sir.

817
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,296
Come on, Sergeant.
Where else?

818
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,629
Gimme a minute, all right?
Lemme think. Um...

819
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,915
Across the street, the Mandarin...
The Mandarin?

820
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,395
Nah, their cameras
face the wrong direction.

821
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,155
Remember, that kid
stole a purse from Solas?

822
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,912
He ran into Peet's.

823
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,072
Ah, I got it...
Um, Back Bay Social Club!

824
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,760
Teddy put in new
patio cameras last year.

825
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,438
Back Bay Social Club.

826
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,317
Searching Back Bay Social Club.

827
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,351
I got him!

828
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,788
Back Bay Social Club.
2:40 p.m.

829
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,350
I have a new angle on his face.
His left eye, the chin.

830
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,795
It's still not clear enough
for facial recognitions.

831
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,032
All right, push that out to CART team,
see if they can fill in the blanks.

832
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,110
Doin' great, Sergeant.
Keep going.

833
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,956
All right. 2:42 p.m.
Whiskey's Steak House.

834
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,952
- Whiskey's Steak House!
- Whiskey's Steak House!

835
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,350
Got him. 2:37.
White Hat's standing with someone.

836
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,397
It's a man wearing aviators.

837
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,119
Looks like they know each other.

838
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,510
Motherfucker!
You fuckin' piece 'a shit!

839
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,479
Two bombers.

840
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,039
- Give me a kiss.
- No!

841
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,633
- Then get out.
- Stop it.

842
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:37,720
Get out.

843
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,040
There you go. You gotta put
the bunny, like, right there.

844
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,752
No.

845
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,598
- Yes. What?
- No.

846
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,999
What do you mean, no?

847
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,696
...still a very heavy police presence.

848
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,918
The FBI reportedly zeroing in
on a possible suspect.

849
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,616
They figured that out
quicker than you thought, huh?

850
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,313
And amid all the questions
about a possible suspect today...

851
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,719
Come on. I'll help you.

852
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,336
Your baby doesn't
know how to tie her shoes.

853
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,839
I've got it.

854
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,518
- Jahar?
- Nah, I don't want any.

855
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,536
...caused chaos in the markets today.

856
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,096
It also, we understand, forced the FBI

857
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,315
to cancel what was
a scheduled news conference.

858
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,550
It has never been
rescheduled since.

859
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,995
How can we have zero hits
on facial recognition?

860
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,856
Well, the technology isn't perfect,
Governor, we've got partial images.

861
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,029
We've got bad angles.

862
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,951
These are pretty clear
fucking pictures.

863
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,576
One of the suspects
is wearing sunglasses.

864
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,216
- Run it through the NSA's system.
- We're using the NSA's system, sir.

865
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,515
We need to get these
photos out to the public.

866
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,194
Not yet. We have a couple of
decent leads, but right now...

867
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,350
We release these photos,
the city eats these guys.

868
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,475
No, I agree.

869
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,136
So why don't you
get over there and say somethin'?

870
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,240
Look, this is Ed's fuckin' deal
right now, all right?

871
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,118
These guys are somebody's friends,
neighbors, co-workers.

872
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,873
- You got no balls.
- I've got fucking plenty of balls.

873
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,216
I'm not gettin' involved
with the Governor.

874
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,336
I'll go over there
and say somethin'.

875
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,416
You wanna get yourself
suspended again?

876
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,590
If we release those photos now,
it tells the suspects

877
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,238
that we don't know who they are,

878
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,296
- and that puts them ahead of us...
- That's true, but...

879
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,038
But what?
But what if we're wrong?

880
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,336
What if these men are innocent?

881
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,976
And God forbid,
they also happen to be Muslims,

882
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,479
we will be crucified!

883
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,630
They don't look like
prototypical jihadists to me.

884
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,680
What does a prototypical
jihadist look like, Rick?

885
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,079
You got a photo of one?

886
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,390
Okay, listen, that all sounds
very by-the-book, Rick,

887
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,152
okay, but we owe people answers.

888
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,674
We can't just sit back
and keep analyzing data.

889
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,394
What does your gut tell you?

890
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,995
My gut tells me that
these are probably our guys.

891
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,675
But I'm not ready
to release the photos.

892
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,354
Gotta give our people
some more time to work.

893
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,589
Okay. Okay, it's decided.

894
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,479
We'll wait.

895
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,000
At this time,
there have been no new developments

896
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,640
regarding the Boston
Marathon bombings...

897
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,896
We wish we had better information

898
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,576
as far as them being able to
find somebody right now.

899
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,716
It just seems like
it's an ongoing active search...

900
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,550
It was a beautiful day to be in Boston.

901
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,838
And then, in an instant,

902
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,275
the day's beauty was shattered.

903
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:59,359
For millions of us,
what happened on Monday is personal.

904
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,110
It's personal.

905
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,873
So we come together
to pray and mourn.

906
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,470
But we also
come together today

907
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,554
to reaffirm that the spirit
of this city is undaunted.

908
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,555
And the spirit of this country
shall remain undimmed.

909
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,429
That's the spirit
you've displayed in recent days.

910
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,550
- Hey. Hey, Li.
- Hey.

911
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,914
- Hey, Sean.
- Oh, hey...

912
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,536
I like those glasses.
Those are new, huh?

913
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,629
Yeah, thanks.

914
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,439
We needed a study break,
so I thought you might like one, too.

915
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,879
Thanks, Li, yeah.

916
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,871
Coffee Coolattas.
These are great.

917
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,236
Uh, well, we should go back to work.

918
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,595
But, um, Saturday night,
Zac Brown Band?

919
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,557
Yeah, that's right.
Are you guys...

920
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,760
I'll make sure all you guys
are covered, so you're in.

921
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,559
It's just gonna be us.
Is that cool?

922
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,108
- Yeah?
- That's better. Yeah.

923
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,031
- Yeah?
- No, I prefer that, yeah.

924
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,634
- Cool. Bye.
- All right.

925
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,392
Good seein' you guys.

926
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,717
All right, let's pipe it down
so I can make this quick, please.

927
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,434
Situation in Boston remains in flux.

928
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,274
Let's be prepared to augment
should they require our assistance.

929
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,396
Uh, speed limit
on Common Street

930
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,994
has now officially been
down to 25 for a month.

931
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,150
So, warning period is over.

932
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,470
Quit giving warnings there
a week ago, Sarge.

933
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,232
I gave Mimi O'Brien a citation

934
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,396
for speeding
and expired registration.

935
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,948
Well, you're a braver man
than I am, Gunga Din.

936
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,318
We got an information vacuum.

937
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,913
Those are not our guys.

938
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,638
Meanwhile, you guys
aren't any closer

939
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,029
to identifying the two
we're really lookin' for.

940
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,475
We need to release
those pictures.

941
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,790
If we release the photos now,
we have zero control.

942
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,912
If we overplay our hand,
we may force these guys to react.

943
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,116
Gentlemen, if I may?

944
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,873
Right now,
Boston's workin' against us.

945
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,679
As normal, you've got a murder,
no one rats.

946
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,115
We don't got that problem,
'cause in this city,

947
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,634
when it comes to terrorism,
everybody wants to talk.

948
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,456
Look, you got a lot of people talkin', but
they're talkin' about the wrong people.

949
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,155
You release the photos of our guys,
sit back and listen. Trust me.

950
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,630
You gotta start lettin' Boston
work for us, I'm telling you.

951
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,075
I understand Boston,

952
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,196
but I can't just snap my fingers.

953
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,496
This decision goes all the way up
to the Attorney General.

954
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,556
Then give me his number.
I'll call him right now!

955
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,995
This is my fuckin' city, Rick!

956
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,798
Release the goddamn pictures!

957
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,919
Say again?

958
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,314
Hold on, stay on the line.

959
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,551
Don't lecture me on intelligence,
okay, Ed? That is what I do!

960
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,113
- Sir?
- What?

961
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,430
White Hat, Black Hat.
Fox got the pictures.

962
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,296
They want what we have,
or they're gonna release them.

963
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,514
Repeat that. Say that again.

964
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,680
Fox is gonna release the pictures
in 20 minutes, sir.

965
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,234
With or without a consult.

966
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,593
Okay, I'm all about
inter-agency cooperation,

967
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,638
but when this is over,
I am gonna hunt down the piece of shit

968
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,951
that leaked those photos,
and I will fucking ruin him!

969
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,195
I'm not gonna let Fox News
run this investigation.

970
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,233
We will release the pictures
as soon as the president is wheels up.

971
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,350
We initially developed
one person of interest,

972
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:33,116
not knowing if that individual was working
alone or in concert with others.

973
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,839
The FBI has developed
a second suspect.

974
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,753
Today, we are enlisting
the public's help

975
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,308
in identifying these two suspects...

976
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,868
Officials say
they've made the images public now

977
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:46,394
because they need help
in connecting the faces

978
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,600
of the potential suspects...

979
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,896
...the other walking
just a short distance behind.

980
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,999
They believe that
someone out there would recognize

981
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,310
at least one,
perhaps both of these men,

982
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,520
and call in some vital information
to law enforcement.

983
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,673
If you have any information at all,
please reach out to the FBI.

984
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,869
Investigators tonight
are working to identify a young white man

985
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:18,190
spotted in surveillance video
from the Lord & Taylor.

986
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,556
He was in the crowd
right before the second explosion.

987
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,313
He was carrying a backpack,
talking on his cell phone,

988
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,550
wearing a black jacket,
gray hoodie,

989
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,074
and a white baseball cap
on backwards.

990
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,936
No one should
attempt to apprehend him

991
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,712
except law enforcement.

992
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,631
Let me reiterate that caution.

993
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,154
Do not take any action on your own.

994
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,356
...identifying these two suspects.

995
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,035
Somebody out there knows
these individuals as friends.

996
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,016
Federal law
enforcement authorities now believe

997
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,271
that a team of at least two men
carried out the bombings here.

998
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,909
Not a lone wolf,
but two men described tonight

999
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,797
as armed and extremely dangerous.

1000
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,274
We initially developed one person...

1001
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,616
They are now
the world's most wanted men.

1002
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,871
Two men in their 20s caught on tape.
Suspect number one...

1003
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,915
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

1004
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,151
Get everything packed in the car.
It's time to leave.

1005
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,598
All right.
Can I have my gun now, though?

1006
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,560
I just like...
I really want the gun now.

1007
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,392
Dzhokhar,
you will get your gun!

1008
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,391
- When?
- Enough!

1009
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,596
The pictures are blurry.
They're no good.

1010
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,439
No, the pictures are good.

1011
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,954
Pictures are really good.

1012
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,553
- Hey, man, where's Jahar at?
- I don't know.

1013
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,120
Did you guys see
the press conference?

1014
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,000
One of the guys looks
exactly fuckin' like him.

1015
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,776
- Yo, that's what I fuckin' said.
- No way. Everybody's fuckin' paranoid.

1016
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,776
- He looks exactly fuckin' like him.
- He texted me.

1017
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,438
He said to get some of his stuff.

1018
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,318
Go ahead, Dias.
I got a study group to get to.

1019
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,630
- Don't steal my shit!
- Fuck you, man.

1020
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,239
Fuck you!
Don't touch my shit.

1021
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,072
- Study group, dickhead.
- Fuckin' asshole.

1022
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,948
Gnarly, man, you can't drive
that thing on the beach.

1023
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,837
You're gonna get arrested again!

1024
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,150
Relax, Bob.
You can't get arrested...

1025
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,151
This joint is kicked.

1026
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,639
It's all done.
It's cashed out.

1027
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,071
Where does Dzhokhar
keep his weed at?

1028
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,589
Of course.
The coveted closet.

1029
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,597
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1030
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,676
Shit.
There's no weed in here.

1031
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,479
What's that shit?

1032
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,869
Don't fuckin' know.
Is that fuckin' fireworks?

1033
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,191
What the fuck does he need
fireworks for?

1034
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,874
- Hey, these are fuckin' BB's, man.
- What are you saying?

1035
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,256
What are you fucking
talking about, man?

1036
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,793
This is fuckin' bomb shit.

1037
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,216
Are you guys really that fuckin' high
you can't see this shit?

1038
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,416
- What the fuck do we do?
- I don't know, man. You found it.

1039
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:57,998
Seriously? We found it.

1040
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,389
Quiet the fuck down
and put the stuff in the bag.

1041
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,075
We can't leave it here.
Bag it up, man!

1042
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,798
What the fuck you think
I'm doin', man?

1043
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,440
We're still waiting
to hear more about suspects.

1044
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,536
With pictures
being available to the public,

1045
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,596
the FBI has yet to receive any...

1046
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,559
We now await
one key lead, the names of these men.

1047
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,736
- Is it hot? Yeah.
- It's fucking hot.

1048
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,520
- So you broke a finger cheerleading?
- Yeah.

1049
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,456
I did a backflip and came down
on my hand like that.

1050
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,896
Were you before, like, people throw you
up really high, and then you come...

1051
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,956
Yeah, I fell.
I got a concussion my senior year.

1052
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,040
And I tried to get up and I tried to walk,
and my entire left body was numb.

1053
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,394
Like, I couldn't walk.

1054
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,153
I feel like I'd be really
lonely if I was here.

1055
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,959
- Like, you're alone, right?
- Yeah, it's okay.

1056
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:44,669
In the beginning,
like three years ago, it was harder.

1057
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:48,878
Now, it's like, you make new friends
and you find new people.

1058
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,432
You wanted a gun.
Now you need a gun.

1059
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,431
Unless you know someone
that has one.

1060
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,556
242, what's your status?

1061
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,911
I'm in the Quad, tucked next to
the Koch building for the next 45.

1062
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,759
Got my eyes
on Main Street and Vasser.

1063
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,638
After that,
I got dinner break for 30.

1064
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,519
Can I do it?

1065
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,309
Denver 544. Koch is quiet.

1066
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,880
We're gonna rotate you
over to Kresge.

1067
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,676
Yeah, it is very dry out here.

1068
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,957
So if you want me to rotate,
I'm absolutely ready.

1069
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,519
Copy that.

1070
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,794
Grab the gun, Dzhokhar!

1071
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,196
No, no! No, no, no!

1072
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,998
- Come on!
- He won't fucking let go!

1073
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,120
Fuck you!

1074
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,196
- Why won't you let go?
- Watch out!

1075
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,520
No!

1076
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,832
- Let's go!
- What now, motherfucker?

1077
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:37,040
Hey!

1078
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,910
Come on,
you fuckin' piece of shit!

1079
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,353
Let's go! Come on!

1080
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,072
All units. All units.

1081
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:50,594
This is a Commonwealth-wide
all-points bulletin.

1082
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,796
We have a report
of an officer shot at MIT.

1083
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,599
Requesting available units
for search for suspects.

1084
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,875
Witnesses report
two men fleeing the scene.

1085
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,315
Caucasian, medium build,
dark clothing.

1086
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,356
Suspects are armed.
Use caution.

1087
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,834
A team, we have no suspect
information at this time.

1088
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,757
Nothing.

1089
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,109
Sorry to bother, uh,
can you help me real quick?

1090
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:58,080
Sorry.

1091
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,188
Yeah, I just want you to...

1092
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,355
- Hey, don't...
- Do not move.

1093
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,192
Do not fucking move.

1094
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,708
What is your name?

1095
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,795
Manny.

1096
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,920
Yeah? Do you know about
the Marathon bombing, Manny?

1097
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,069
Yes, I know.

1098
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,194
- Do you know who did it?
- No.

1099
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,953
I did that.
You understand?

1100
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:28,548
And I just killed a police officer.

1101
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,995
Bet you got a lot of money.
Give me your wallet.

1102
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,559
Let's go.
Give me your wallet.

1103
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,153
Yeah, yeah...
Just take everything.

1104
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,434
Just take it.
Take everything.

1105
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,152
Your name is not Manny.

1106
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,915
No, it's...
My name's Dun Meng.

1107
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,389
It a-sound... it a-sound like Manny.
It sounds like Manny.

1108
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:58,870
If you lie to me again,
wallahi, I will kill you.

1109
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,916
I'm sorry.

1110
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,434
- Open the back!
- Do not fucking move.

1111
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,839
Open the back!

1112
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:06,717
- Open the back.
- Okay, okay.

1113
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,395
Easy, buddy. Go ahead.
Good. Give me the keys.

1114
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,796
- Stay in the car.
- Okay.

1115
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,079
I'll get the pressure cookers.

1116
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,637
- Is that it?
- That's it. Get in the car.

1117
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,633
Shit.

1118
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,677
That's all right.
Easy, easy.

1119
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,472
You can just take the car.

1120
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,755
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

1121
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,229
Follow me.
All right. Let's go.

1122
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,151
Do not say anything.
Stay quiet.

1123
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,437
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

1124
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,954
Get in the car.
You understand?

1125
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,096
- You're gonna get in the car...
- Yes, yes.

1126
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,296
- ...and you're gonna be quiet.
- Yes.

1127
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,320
All right? Let's go.

1128
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:02,755
Get in the car.

1129
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,988
Get in the car right now.

1130
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,308
- Jahar?
- Yeah?

1131
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,799
- Watch him.
- All right.

1132
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:17,069
- Yo, does this have an iPod plug-in?
- Huh?

1133
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:21,153
- Does your car have an iPod plug-in?
- No. No.

1134
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,674
You're sure? What about Bluetooth?
You got Bluetooth?

1135
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:27,471
I can plug my phone in
and play some stuff?

1136
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,719
Sorry, there's no Bluetooth.

1137
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,156
Do you have anyone
that cares about you?

1138
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,230
Nobody care about me here.

1139
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,878
Then put on the seatbelt.

1140
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,236
No one gets through,
you hear me?

1141
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,630
We need oxygen now.

1142
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,631
I don't know, Travis, it's bad.

1143
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,270
Yeah, it's Sean. I...

1144
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,955
They tried to take his gun,
but he wouldn't give it up.

1145
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,234
They shot him. They...

1146
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,673
No pulse. He's gone.

1147
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:54,716
Dookie, take it easy.
Stay under the limit.

1148
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,109
Damn. This thing moves.

1149
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:59,873
Really?
Yo, can I drive it?

1150
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,070
- You wanna drive it?
- Yeah.

1151
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:03,639
- No way.
- Why?

1152
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:06,109
Bro, I've never driven a Benz.
I really wanna drive a Benz.

1153
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,430
Jahar, you're not going to
drive this car.

1154
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,511
Get over it.

1155
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,234
You're going the wrong way, Officer.

1156
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,390
Hey! Turn around! Hey, you!

1157
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,519
Where are you headin'? Home?

1158
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,353
- We're goin' to his mother's house.
- All right, get off the street.

1159
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,336
The Boston Marathon
tragedy is being described

1160
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,797
as the worst act of domestic terrorism
since the September 11 th attacks.

1161
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,440
However, unlike the attacks
on the World Trade Center...

1162
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,630
Fuck them!

1163
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,950
You know that's bullshit,
right, Manny?

1164
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,031
- Yes.
- 9/11...

1165
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:08,155
Uh...

1166
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:10,629
Muslims didn't
blow up those buildings.

1167
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,030
- The U.S. government did.
- Yes, I know.

1168
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:15,394
- You know?
- I know.

1169
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,736
Are you saying yes
because you believe it,

1170
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,120
or are you saying yes because
you don't want us to kill you?

1171
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,232
Sorry, I don't know who did it.
9/11...

1172
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,200
Yo, you need to educate yourself, dog.

1173
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,896
For real, that's the problem
with this country.

1174
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:39,275
No one knows what goes down.
America is fake as fuck.

1175
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,473
The government did all that shit.
The government.

1176
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,279
To make Americans
hate real Muslims.

1177
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,119
A lot of people who say
they were at 9/11, they're all actors.

1178
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,296
- I didn't know that.
- Well, now you know.

1179
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,550
Of course you didn't.
You're conditioned by the media.

1180
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,640
Yeah.

1181
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,909
Take your ATM card.
Give it to Jahar.

1182
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,514
What is your PIN number?

1183
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,397
Your PIN number!
I need your PIN number.

1184
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,029
- What is your PIN number?
- 6-2-2-8.

1185
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,872
- Did you get that?
- What?

1186
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:15,396
- 6...
- 6-2-2-8.

1187
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,313
6-2-2-8. Okay.

1188
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:26,150
Okay, Jahar, get as much
money as you can, okay?

1189
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,992
- Well, I look wack as fuck.
- Jahar!

1190
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,116
- Get as much money as you can.
- All right.

1191
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,310
Times Square is...

1192
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,676
42nd Street and Broadway...

1193
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:17,239
Boom!

1194
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:21,233
Time to New York, 3 hours, 42 minutes.

1195
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:24,915
Please, can I just leave
and you can take the car?

1196
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,960
- You want to leave?
- You can just...

1197
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,468
You want to leave the car?
Are you asking me to leave the car?

1198
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,800
- Fuck that.
- No, no, no.

1199
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,911
I leave the car, you take the car.

1200
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,256
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're gonna stay right there.

1201
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,111
I won't...
I won't call the police.

1202
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:41,951
Please, I have a family in China.

1203
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,472
I have a mama,
I have a daddy.

1204
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,151
I have a brother.

1205
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,149
I have...

1206
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,437
Please?
I don't call anyone.

1207
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:56,398
Just let me go.

1208
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,268
Shut the fuck up.

1209
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,239
Fill up the tank.

1210
01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:19,391
The pump's busted.
It's cash only.

1211
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,833
- Get something to eat, too.
- All right. Want somethin' to eat?

1212
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:25,920
No.

1213
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,070
- You're not hungry?
- No, that's okay.

1214
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,151
I'll get him something.

1215
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,517
Gonna be a long ride.

1216
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,556
- Fuck you!
- Fuck!

1217
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,958
What the fuck happened?

1218
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,277
Call the police!
Call police, please!

1219
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:33,918
- What happened?
- Please call!

1220
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,136
Two people,
they kidnapped me.

1221
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,656
They said they're
the Marathon bombers...

1222
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,432
Call the police!

1223
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,872
9-1-1 recorded line.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1224
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,996
I am in Mobil gas station.

1225
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,197
I have one claiming
someone wants to shoot him.

1226
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,918
And he stay inside,
and he won't leave.

1227
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Can I speak with him?

1228
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,753
Hello? Please help me!
Please help me!

1229
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,957
Two people, they came to my car,
and they have guns.

1230
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,720
All units, possible carjacking.

1231
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,432
At least two males,
white, mid-twenties

1232
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,080
at the Mobil station
off Memorial and River Street.

1233
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:08,755
Witness is an Asian male,
name unclear.

1234
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:10,831
Emergency operator had trouble
understanding him.

1235
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,399
Requesting units to investigate.

1236
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,472
Patrol Unit 488 responding.

1237
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,236
I don't understand.
Why are we doing this?

1238
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,753
Why are we doing this?

1239
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,149
Why do I have to take this car?
This car's so much better!

1240
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,440
Because they're gonna
be looking for us now in this one.

1241
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,096
No, but then why don't
we just get another car?

1242
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:39,336
We'll just get, like, a better car.

1243
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,616
- We can jack a Lambo...
- Get the fucking bombs.

1244
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,016
- ...or something actually working.
- Get the fucking bombs, all right?

1245
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,256
Just listen to me for a second!

1246
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,396
If we get another car,
like, an actual car...

1247
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,948
Listen to me, Tamerlan, please!
Listen to me!

1248
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,156
Stop treating me like a fucking baby!
Listen to me!

1249
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:53,674
You fucking distracted me!
You distracted me.

1250
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:55,216
That's why he got away.
Do you understand that?

1251
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,296
What? This is not my fault!
Are you fucking kidding me?

1252
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,550
This is your fault!
You were up front with him!

1253
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,136
I was in the back the whole time, and I
went to get snacks, you piece of shit.

1254
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,232
Don't fucking accuse me!
Don't fucking accuse me!

1255
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:07,096
Fucking be quiet right now.
Do you understand?

1256
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,599
- Dzhokhar...
- Okay. Okay.

1257
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,336
- You be fucking quiet right now.
- All right, all right.

1258
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,736
- Or I'll fucking kill you myself!
- All right, all right.

1259
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,716
- Do you understand me, Jahar?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1260
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,856
I'll fucking shoot you myself!

1261
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,520
- All right. Yeah.
- Do you understand me?

1262
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:21,679
You distracted me.
That's how he got away.

1263
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,536
You're gonna do as I say and grab the
fucking bombs and put them in the trunk.

1264
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,915
- All right.
- And do as I fucking say, you understand?

1265
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,194
- Yeah.
- Right now.

1266
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,836
You fucking get in the car!

1267
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,876
I'll find somewhere
to ditch the Mercedes.

1268
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,029
And you will follow me.

1269
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,712
- Got it?
- Yeah.

1270
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,432
- Hey, Phil, what's up?
- He's over here, Sarge.

1271
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,616
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- I can't get a word out of him.

1272
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:08,856
Let me talk to him for a second.
Sir, how are you? You okay?

1273
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,598
Two people, they take my car.

1274
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,557
They take my car over there in the...

1275
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,952
They drive me around for, like,
an hour, and they say they put a...

1276
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,554
- Wait, what did you say?
- These people, they tell me

1277
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:22,074
they gonna do the explosion
in New York.

1278
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,195
What?

1279
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,714
They're the Marathon race bombers.

1280
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,439
Wait, no, no, calm down.
Just calm down for a second.

1281
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,078
Did you just say
"Marathon bombers"?

1282
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,628
They said to you that they were
the Marathon bombers?

1283
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,640
Yes, they told me.
They are the Marathon bombers!

1284
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,989
Listen to me.
What kind of car do you drive?

1285
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,635
It's my black Mercedes SUV.

1286
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,756
That car has a GPS.

1287
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:48,472
The tracking number
is 3422347.

1288
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,429
- Well, how do you know that number?
- I just remember.

1289
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,760
Please, they're very dangerous.
You have to catch them.

1290
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,176
You know what? It took a lot of balls
to escape like you did.

1291
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,236
Hey, you're a very brave guy.
Do you hear me?

1292
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,959
Go catch those motherfuckers!

1293
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,070
Fuck! Fuck!
Wasn't my fucking fault!

1294
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,633
Wasn't my fucking fault!

1295
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:21,632
Look, you fucking fuck!

1296
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,678
All units,
be on alert for a black Mercedes SUV,

1297
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:27,149
possible carjacking suspect.

1298
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:30,630
GPS shows the vehicle in Watertown,
south of Mount Auburn Street.

Baker 364 responding.

1300
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,912
All right, Chris,
maybe stay awake tonight, you know?

1301
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,911
Just for a change of pace.

1302
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,549
Sarge, it's Joey.

1303
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,720
Think I got eyes on
that Mercedes called in earlier.

1304
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,799
I'm gonna flip around
and follow him.

1305
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,196
He stopped.
He's on Laurel off Dexter.

1306
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,799
Hold up, Reynolds.
I'm comin' in behind you.

1307
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:05,670
Light 'em up whenever you're ready.

1308
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,957
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1309

61 Laurel Street!

1312
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:44,710
- Jesus Christ! Joey, you all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm all right!

1313
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,999
Drop your weapon
and come out...

1314
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,593
Jesus!

1315
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,312
Give it up!
You got nowhere to go! Fuck!

1316
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,136
All units, we have shots fired
at the vehicle in question from Cambridge.

1317
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:18,673
Last seen near Dexter Ave.

1318
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,435
We need units
to assist in Watertown.

1319
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,936
- Can I use the gun?
- No, no, grab the bomb.

1320
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,296
- Let me use it.
- Grab the bomb. Get it.

1321
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,958
Joey, use the car for cover!

1322
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,400
Light it! Light! Light, light, light!

1323
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,680
Ahh! God!

1324
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,117
Oh, Jesus!
God fucking damn it!

1325

Follow me! Follow my voice!

1327
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,432
Jesus! Dispatch,
I need backup down here!

They've got explosives.

We can take 'em.
We can take 'em.

1337
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,353
How many clips you got?

1338
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,431
- This is my last one.
- Shit!

1339

Fuck you!

1340

Doing good.
You're doing very good.

01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,799
You okay?

1342

Fuck! I'm goin' for
my machine gun! Stay here.

1343

You cocksuckin'
piece of fuckin' shit!

1344
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,190
What the fuck?!
Sarge, I got a mini-sledge!

1345
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,151
Give 'em hell, brother!

1346

Whoa! Miguel!
Miguel, it's me, Joey!

1347
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,816
Holy shit, dude!
Are you all right?

1348
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:17,976
I'm all right.
Push onto Laurel.

1349
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,416
And cover my ass.
I'll get behind you.

1350
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,759
- Let's go!
- Go slow.

1351
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,033
Okay, go, go!

1352
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,799
It won't light.

1353
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,720

Fall back!
Fall back! Go, go, go!

1367
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,056
Come on!
Let's get to the car!

1368
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,456
Go! Get behind me!
Get behind me!

1369
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,595
Come on, come on!

1370
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,035
They got fuckin' bombs, Sarge!
They're shooting at us!

1371
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,954
Yeah, no shit.
I'm gonna flank 'em.

1372
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,793
Joey!

1373
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:04,672
We got units comin' in!

1374
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,309
This is it, Jahar.
This is it.

1375
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:30,550
- My fucking leg!
- You okay? Are you okay?

1376
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:35,158
You should prepare. Now.

1377
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,073
Want some more, motherfuckers?
You want some more?

1378
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,829
- The fuck?
- Jesus!

1379
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,471
Donohue! On my six!

1380
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:08,999
Take the car to New York.
You finish it!

1381
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:11,435
We're killing them all.
We're killing them all!

1382
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:12,669
Go fuck 'em up.

1383
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,953
Loud explosions!
Loud explosions! Loud explosions!

1384
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,473
Fuck.

1385
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,869
Dookie, go!

1386
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:16,308
Take him out!

1387
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,357
Officer down!
We need an ambulance!

1388
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:43,873
Get an ambulance now!

1389
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:45,656
Put your hands on there!
Put your hands on there!

1390
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:46,715
Hold on, Donohue.

1391
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:48,216
Get him out of here!
Hang in there! Hang in there!

1392
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,674
Get an ambulance!
We need help! Officer down!

1393
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,640
Go, go, go!

1394
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,513
This is Delta 984 in pursuit
of a black Mercedes SUV

1395
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,079
headin' east on Laurel Street!

1396
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:05,393
Stop the vehicle!
Stop the vehicle!

1397
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:06,480
What the...

1398
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,160
Fuck!

1399
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:13,336
- Get the fuck on the ground!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

1400
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,634
BPD, you fuckin' morons!

1401
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,856
We heard black truck!
I'm fuckin' sorry! You all right?

1402
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,520
- That's him right there! Come on!
- All right, let's go! Move out!

1403
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,677
77-16 to Control.

1404
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,751
Need an ambulance
on Laurel Avenue.

1405
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,559
Suspect in custody.
Shot and run over.

1406
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,313
Repeat. Shot and run over.

1407
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,274
I gotta fucking quit smoking.

1408
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,188
He's gone.

1409
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,336
- Paddles.
- Charge to 200, please.

1410
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,828
- Nothing. No pulse.
- Charging to 200.

1411
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,359
- All clear.
- Clear.

1412
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,456
- Anything in response?
- No.

1413
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,879
Raise the charge to 200.

1414
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,096
- Charging.
- Clear?

1415
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,509
- Clear.
- Internal paddles.

1416
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:07,856
Let's have a direct shock to the heart.

1417
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,256
Chest compression, please,
while we do this.

1418
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,840
I need you to step back right now.
This has to happen now.

1419
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,136
- Get outta here!
- Excuse me, step back.

1420
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,958
I'm with the FBI. This has to happen
right now. Just stand back.

1421
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:17,189
Good Lord.

1422
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,680
Give me some more sponges.
I gotta stop the bleeding in here.

1423
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,915
- He's in.
- Bag him.

1424
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,480
- Get the paddles ready.
- Nothing. No pulse.

1425
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,669
- All clear.
- Clear!

1426
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:30,797
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1427
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,359
Okay, I'm calling it.

1428
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:35,352
1:35 a.m. Mark it.

1429
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,079
Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

1430
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,912
Lived in Cambridge with his wife

1431
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,036
Katherine and his
younger brother Dzhokhar.

1432
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:46,636
Get HRT, S.O.G., bomb techs over there
right now and shut it down.

1433
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:48,711
Give me a hard perimeter.
Evacuate a block.

1434
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,000
- Make it two blocks.
- Got it.

1435
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:51,496
- We have a problem.
- What's up?

1436
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,511
- Black Hat, Tamerlan Tsarnaev?
- Yes.

1437
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,956
- We might have known this guy.
- Known him how?

1438
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,996
He popped up
on a Guardian watch list.

1439
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:01,275
All right, get me the list.

1440
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,793
Right fucking here!

1441
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:08,269
During the pursuit, one of the suspects

1442
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:10,999
was critically injured,
transported to hospital,

1443
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,150
where he was pronounced dead.

1444
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,071
Now, here's where we stand.

1445
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:18,277
Extensive manhunt in Watertown...

1446
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:21,376
Report that an Asian male
who came in contact with the suspects

1447
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:24,915
told police that the brothers discussed
New York City as their next destination.

1448
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,470
You heard?
We got positive ID on Black Hat.

1449
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,993
Yes, Tsarnaev.
We heard. Black Hat.

1450
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,314
What about White Hat?

1451
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:34,595
How sure are we that
he's still within the perimeter?

1452
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,176
It's hard to be sure
in the dark like this.

1453
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,758
My guys are runnin' on fumes.

1454
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:41,278
- Two sheds.
- We're tracking reports.

1455
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,828
A taxi picked up a guy
matching White Hat's description

1456
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,433
from Watertown to South Station.

1457
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,158
Could be he's on his way
to New York.

1458
01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:49,919
Okay.

1459
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,309
Warn Governor
Cuomo and Mayor Bloomberg.

1460
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:56,633
As for Boston, I'm calling it.

1461
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,795
We're shutting down the city
until further notice.

1462
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:03,919
Inform all transit systems
and let's get a PBA out immediately.

1463
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,072
All civilians are asked
to please shelter in place.

1464
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:09,594
Every inch of this city
is getting searched.

1465
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:11,636
You positive
you wanna do this, Governor?

1466
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,358
That's close to martial law.

1467
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,874
T ell your people to be judicious
with the door kicking.

1468
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,030
We got laws.
People still have rights.

1469
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:22,511
This murderer is
not causing any more harm to this city.

1470
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,033
We're shuttin' it down.

1471
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,798
State Control
with an important announcement.

1472
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:38,800
Due to the ongoing manhunt
for a person wanted...

1473
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:41,480
Police in your area
are conducting an ongoing manhunt

1474
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,990
for a person wanted in connection
with Monday's Marathon bombing.

1475
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:48,675
All businesses in these towns
remain closed until further notice.

1476
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,716
Residents in Watertown, Newton,

1477
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,712
Waltham, Belmont,
Cambridge are advised...

1478
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,677
...are advised to stay indoors.

1479
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,354
Residents should remain
and not answer the door

1480
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,112
unless it is a police officer.

1481
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,953
Residents are advised
to stay away from windows.

1482
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:25,118
Close your windows.
Go back inside your houses.

1483
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,238
Don't answer the door.

1484
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,350
Boston Police,
open the door, please.

1485
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,040
You got anybody
in the house with you?

1486
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:44,678
No, it's okay. It's cool.

1487
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,176
You're supposed to be
stayin' inside.

1488
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:47,736
So get a little air
and then head back, all right?

1489
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,840
- Will do.
- All right, pal.

1490
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,069
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1491
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:51,275
All right, let's move.

1492
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,794
Per FBI command,
anyone making contact

1493
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:55,598
with suspect's wife
Katherine Russell

1494
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,029
is instructed to detain
in place and advise.

1495
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:00,031
Do not Mirandize.
Do not interview.

1496
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:02,111
- He just said no Miranda.
- Yeah, I know.

1497
01:38:02,680 --> 01:38:04,750
- I mean, I never hear of that. You?
- No. Never.

1498
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:08,116
- Who would call that?
- I don't know. AG? CIA?

1499
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:10,350
Fuckin' President.
How do I know?

1500
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:14,592
Basically he's got
home videos, boxing, wrestling.

1501
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:16,033
Stuff we see all the time.

1502
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,835
And porn.
A lot of fucking porn.

1503
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,496
This guy watched more porn
than Bin Laden.

1504
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:23,114
Okay, Washington is flying up
a team to interview the wife.

1505
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:24,456
Let's get her picked up
immediately.

1506
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,096
Sir, we just got a hit
on White Hat's phone.

1507
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,473
- Whereabouts?
- U Mass Dartmouth.

1508
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:30,120
- Let's get HRT to U Mass Dartmouth.
- They're on their way, sir.

1509
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:32,796
Dickhead.

1510
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:35,976
You're missing class
for an ass-whuppin'.

1511
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,800
- Wide open, man.
- I'm just letting you know.

1512
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,035
I don't wanna go
to Crystal's stupid party.

1513
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,839
- Go, go, go!
- Shit!

1514
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,439
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1515
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,600
Let me see your face!
Let me see your face!

1516
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:14,111
Don't move! Don't move!
Look at me.

1517
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:17,720
Victor 1-1 to Talk.
We do not have White Hat.

1518
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:20,672
Room is clear
for EOD and Forensics.

1519
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,115
Repeat, we do not have White Hat.

1520
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,590
No. Negative. Right.

1521
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:29,752
We're gettin' tips from kids sayin'
they buy their pot from White Hat.

1522
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,876
Apparently,
he's the biggest dealer at U Mass.

1523
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:33,416
Commish, they just called
from Black Falcon.

1524
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:34,919
They got the wife.

1525
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,159
Not what you were
expecting, huh, Commish?

1526
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,832
It never is.

1527
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,914
S.A.C. DesLauriers?

1528
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,551
- I'm looking for S.A.C. DesLauriers.
- Rick DesLauriers.

1529
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:59,074
Hi, I'm Mike Thomas.
May I have a word with you?

1530
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,394
We're gonna handle
the interview from here.

1531
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,876
- Have any of you spoken to her yet?
- Not yet.

1532
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,428
- This is everything we have on her.
- We're good. We're good.

1533
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:09,710
Thank you, gentlemen.
We will take it from here.

1534
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,152
Assalam-alaikum.

1535
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,115
Assalam-alaikum.

1536
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,115
You disrespect the Prophet?

1537
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,438
Walaikum-assalam.

1538
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:59,428
Katherine,
are there more bombs?

1539
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,114
My name is Veronica.

1540
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,192
I was born in a tent
with three walls

1541
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,352
that said UNICEF on the sides

1542
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:17,716
to a mother who could not
write her own name.

1543
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:22,789
You were born in a room
full of flowers and balloons.

1544
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,350
Your mother is a nurse.
She calls you Katie.

1545
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:30,228
- You know nothing about me.
- Your best friend, Gina Crawford,

1546
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,517
works at a Starbucks in Cambridge

1547
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:35,955
where you tried
to convert her to Islam

1548
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,316
- between skinny caramel macchiatos.
- You know nothing.

1549
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:42,472
Are there more bombs?

1550
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,710
More bombers?

1551
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:48,349
You sent Gina a text
right after the bombing

1552
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:51,557
that said,
"A lot more people are killed

1553
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:55,110
every day in Syria
and other places.

1554
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,033
Innocent people."

1555
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,588
Did you see the footage
on television?

1556
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:07,194
We found explosive residue
from the bombs in your apartment.

1557
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,719
On your kitchen table.
In your kitchen sink.

1558
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:16,029
The kitchen where you made
breakfast for your daughter.

1559
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,269
Are there more bombs?

1560
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,034
You met Tamerlan in a bar
your sophomore year

1561
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:27,509
- at Suffolk University.
- I want a lawyer.

1562
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,591
Tell me, Katie,

1563
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:34,435
what are the rewards
for the wife of a mujahid?

1564
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,636
If one's husband
becomes shahid,

1565
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:39,439
what are the gifts
bestowed upon his wife?

1566
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,749
Your mind is too small
to understand any of this.

1567
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:50,193
- Are there more bombs?
- I want a lawyer.

1568
01:42:50,280 --> 01:42:51,872
- No.
- No?

1569
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,438
- No, what?
- No.

1570
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,757
- I have rights.
- You ain't got shit, sweetheart.

1571
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:04,357
- Are there more bombs?
- Am I under arrest?

1572
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:08,479
- Are there more bombs?
- No? Then you can't keep me.

1573
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,195
Sit!

1574
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,472
Who the fuck are these guys?

1575
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,076
Are there more bombs?

1576
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,310
You're crazy!
You're bat-shit crazy, you know that?

1577
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,551
You are out of your mind.
Your fucking mind.

1578
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,351
Katie...

1579
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:35,159
your husband is gone.

1580
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,631
Forever.

1581
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:47,991
Sweetheart,
you are now a widow.

1582
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:52,111
And have deserted your daughter,

1583
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,829
who will grow up knowing
her father was a monster.

1584
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,356
Stop. Stop!

1585
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,838
He didn't even kiss you
before he left...

1586
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,911
did he?

1587
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:15,598
Katie, for the sake
of your daughter...

1588
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:18,478
are there any more bombs?

1589
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,152
For a Muslim woman,

1590
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:31,590
marriage is a lilting dance
of duality...

1591
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:35,070
strength and submission.

1592
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:40,592
Beautiful, selfless,

1593
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,797
rapturous love of two masters,

1594
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,150
the carnal and the divine.

1595
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,030
The life a Muslim woman lives

1596
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:52,031
is a dangerous
and difficult one.

1597
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:54,714
If she does not
submit to her husband,

1598
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,234
there is a spot reserved
for her in Hell.

1599
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,911
Yes.

1600
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,309
My husband kissed me
before he left,

1601
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,874
and he will kiss me again
when I see him in Heaven.

1602
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,992
And you can't prove anything.

1603
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,676
Excuse me.

1604
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:26,839
- What do you think?
- I think she knew.

1605
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,559
But you're never gonna prove it.

1606
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:33,428
If there are more bombs out there,
she'll never tell us.

1607
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:35,272
How could a mother do that
to her daughter?

1608
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,349
Good luck, huh.

1609
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,296
Please tell me
you have something for us

1610
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:57,471
because we're losing daylight
and I have some decisions to make.

1611
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,913
She's not talking.

1612
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:03,832
Mr. Governor,
we ran a Guardian search.

1613
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:07,111
Black Hat was watchlisted.

1614
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:09,589
He was right there all along,
and we missed him.

1615
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:13,229
All these guys.
All these leads.

1616
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:16,790
You see a Chechen
who's not AI-Qaeda,

1617
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,952
- not even Middle Eastern...
- Come on, Rick. Fuck that.

1618
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,713
We all had access
to the same database.

1619
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,031
I mean, who was lookin' for
some narcissistic little princess?

1620
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,193
Some whiny little bitch who threw
a tantrum because he lost a fight.

1621
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:33,312
Everybody found out
he beat up his girlfriend?

1622
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,676
He's no martyr.
He's a fucking coward.

1623
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:41,599
We covered Barker Street.

1624
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:44,838
We got Washburn...

1625
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,676
You think this shit is preventable?

1626
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,190
- "Preventable"?
- Yeah.

1627
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,272
Seven years ago...

1628
01:47:02,360 --> 01:47:04,078
on March 11th...

1629
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,038
went to the doctor.

1630
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:10,475
Said we couldn't have any kids.

1631
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,551
Carol couldn't have any babies.

1632
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:14,119
Jesus, Tommy.
I didn't know that.

1633
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,555
I remember after,
right after, we went home,

1634
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:21,191
parked the car in the driveway,
and you don't make this kinda stuff up,

1635
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,716
right there,
the Mulaney kids.

1636
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,268
Three little girls out there
playin' hopscotch.

1637
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:30,353
Little five-year-old girls.

1638
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,016
I don't know, we just sat there
dead quiet watchin' 'em play.

1639
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:37,474
- It was like we were in a trance.
- Jesus.

1640
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,354
Sound that Carol made,
it wasn't cryin'.

1641
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:43,759
It was deeper.

1642
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,310
No, cryin' does not describe
that kinda sound.

1643
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:51,154
I looked into her eyes,
and it wasn't pain.

1644
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:54,350
More like war.

1645
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:02,998
Like a war between good and evil
right there in her eyes.

1646
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,518
Like the devil attacked,
and God was inside of her fightin' back.

1647
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,715
We got your back.

1648
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,515
I just held her.

1649
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,670
What could I do? You know?

1650
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,348
That's all I saw today.

1651
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:28,278
Good versus evil,
love versus hate.

1652
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:36,678
The devil hits you like that,

1653
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,990
there's only one weapon
you have to fight back with.

1654
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:41,555
It's love.

1655
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,152
That's the only thing he can't touch.

1656
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,678
What are we gonna do?
We hunt 'em down.

1657
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,711
Catch them, kill them, all that?

1658
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,109
Still gonna get us.

1659
01:49:04,200 --> 01:49:06,998
No way it can ever be
entirely preventable.

1660
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,870
Wrap our arms around each other.

1661
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,272
Let love power us, feed us.

1662
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:25,193
I don't think there's any way
that they could ever win.

1663
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,428
I always knew there was
a thing of beauty

1664
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,114
buried deep in the holy soul
of Tommy Saunders.

1665
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:43,677
Four days ago,

1666
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,069
you and I stood over the body
of a dead kid.

1667
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,797
We can't go back to
all those families with nothin'.

1668
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,871
We owe 'em better.

1669
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:00,715
Bet I'll run the Marathon before you.

1670
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:07,318
It's "befo' you."

1671
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:10,193
Before you.

1672
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:13,632
"Befo' you."
The "R" is silent.

1673
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:18,308
Befo' you.

1674
01:50:27,360 --> 01:50:29,157
Honey, I'm gonna have a smoke.

1675
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,390
- Just gonna be right here, okay?
- No, no, come on.

1676
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,200
Come on, get your foot in.
Get your foot in.

1677
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:34,759
The roller's outta the hull.

1678
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:36,671
- It's okay.
- Came loose from the cover.

1679
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:38,096
- It's gonna ruin the hull.
- Come on.

1680
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,336
It'll just take me
one second, okay?

1681
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,715
- I'm just gonna run out and fix it.
- They'll shoot you!

1682
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:43,631
You're not allowed
to be out there!

1683
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:06,358
Sir! I just got a call.

1684
01:51:06,440 --> 01:51:09,360
Someone thinks they saw someone
suspicious hide in a boat down the street.

1685
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:11,436
- In a boat?
- A boat.

1686
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,999
Hey, Tommy!

1687
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:21,589
- What you got? What's up?
- He's in the boat.

1688
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:23,598
- What?
- He's in the boat.

1689
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,760
There's someone in my boat.

1690
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:26,216
There's someone in your boat?
Where's the boat?

1691
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:27,360
My boat's right around back.

1692
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:29,520
It's got little rollers that
go underneath the cover,

1693
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,536
- and the rollers came off.
- Go ahead, call it in.

1694
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,788
This is Yankee T-3.

1695
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:36,111
We have a possible individual
in a boat at 67 Franklin.

1696
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,752
- Hey, you got a basement?
- Yes.

1697
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:41,559
Go in the house, get your family
in the basement, do not move.

1698
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:04,671
Easy, Tommy. Easy.

1699
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,155
Fuck! Fuck!

1700
01:52:35,240 --> 01:52:36,280
- Jesus.
- What do you got?

1701
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:37,920
- Shut them the fuck up!
- What the fuck?

1702
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,656
It's him. He's in there.
He's in the fuckin' boat.

1703
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,176
It could be rigged
to fuckin' blow! Let's go!

1704
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,776
- We're gonna get him!
- Guys, guys, get back.

1705
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:44,656
- Get back in your vehicles.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1706
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,875
Secure the street!
Clear these fuckin' houses!

1707
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:48,473
This is Yankee T-3.

1708
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:51,632
We need an EOD
and a tac team at 67 Franklin.

1709
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,760
We got a possible suspect
in the backyard in a boat.

1710
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:54,835
He may have a bomb.

1711
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:57,160
Stand down
and let the tactical unit do their job.

1712
01:52:57,720 --> 01:52:59,915
Hey! Hey! You gettin' me?
What frequency are you on?

1713
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:01,792
- Nah, I don't hear ya.
- What?

1714
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,376
The whole state's
fuckin' here, Tommy.

1715
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:04,856
And everyone's
on a different frequency.

1716
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,836
Guys, radio discipline, please!

1717
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:08,797
Stay off the air.
Hold back, please.

1718
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,033
- He's moving!
- Movement!

1719
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:25,075
Hold your fire!

1720
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,315
Hold your fire!

1721
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:32,278
Jesus Christ!

1722
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,191
Guys, lower your weapons.
Everyone.

1723
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:36,109
Shit.

1724
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:37,840
I'll tell ya,
that boat ain't gonna float.

1725
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:39,456
If you're just tuning in right now,

1726
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,800
there has been what appears to be

1727
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:44,549
a major development in what
has been a 19-hour search

1728
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:46,471
for a 19-year-old
bombing suspect

1729
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,993
for the Marathon bombing.

1730
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:50,913
And it has turned into
just absolute mayhem.

1731
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,036
It's time to end this.

1732
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,313
All state and local units
stand down immediately.

1733
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,994
FBI Hostage Rescue
will be taking over.

1734
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,776
All right, let's get strikin'.

1735
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:06,392
Victor 1-1, Victor 2-4,

1736
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:08,118
let's move everybody
into position.

1737
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:09,349
We 're clear out here.

1738
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:44,153
- Who the fuck are you?
- Ma'am, we're with the FBI.

1739
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:46,120
You can go ahead and step down now.
We got this.

1740
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,310
The FBI? Boston FBI?

1741
01:54:48,440 --> 01:54:49,668
No, ma'am.
We're from Quantico.

1742
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,637
Well, I'm from Framingham,
Massachusetts,

1743
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:54,518
and this is my spot,
and I ain't fuckin' leaving.

1744
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:57,231
Glad to have you with us, ma'am.

1745
01:54:57,320 --> 01:55:00,517
Victor 4-4, Victor 1-1,
I got the boat.

1746
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:01,828
We have the boat.

1747
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:03,399
Baseline green.
We got the boat.

1748
01:55:08,440 --> 01:55:09,920
Victor 1-1, Victor 2-8,

1749
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,718
run a few rounds
of 40 Mike bang in there,

1750
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:13,440
try to shake this fellow up
a little bit.

1751
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:15,496
Excuse me, ma'am.
This is about to get pretty loud.

1752
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,192
I don't give a fuck!

1753
01:55:28,920 --> 01:55:30,035
Come on out!

1754
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,592
Come on, Dzhokhar!
Let's go!

1755
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,830
Okay, we have movement.
We have movement.

1756
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,512
Arm's moving.

1757
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:34,996
Victor 3-6. One in custody.

1758
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:37,435
Yeah!

1759
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:51,670
Police took 19-year-old
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev into custody.

1760
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,816
Dangerous,
as we saw. They got him alive.

1761
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,160
There is a great sense of relief.

1762
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,518
This is something.

1763
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:05,034
A crowd celebrating the news of

1764
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,515
the arrest of suspect number two

1765
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:10,160
in the Boston Marathon bombing.

1766
01:57:15,080 --> 01:57:16,991
Let's go, Boston!

1767
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:21,236
We have to thank, definitely,
the public for the tips

1768
01:57:21,320 --> 01:57:24,073
and the help and the information
that we've gotten from them...

1769
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:13,795
Thank you. You're the best
to ever wear that uniform.

1770
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,755
All right, Boston!

1771
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,718
This jersey that we wear today,

1772
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:33,314
it doesn't say "Red Sox."

1773
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:36,073
It say "Boston."

1774
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:40,356
We wanna thank you,
Mayor Menino...

1775
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,633
Governor Patrick...

1776
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:48,630
the whole police department...

1777
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:53,638
for the great job
that they did this past week.

1778
01:59:01,160 --> 01:59:03,390
This is our fuckin' city.

1779
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,353
And nobody gonna
dictate our freedom.

1780
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:13,559
Stay strong!

1781
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:08,556
Two people took many days
and weeks to plan out hate.

1782
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:12,679
But love responded
in an instant.

1783
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:19,592
The bombs went off
and wreaked incredible havoc,

1784
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:21,238
death, and destruction.

1785
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:24,471
But in that immediate
instant afterward,

1786
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,755
people ran toward us.

1787
02:00:27,680 --> 02:00:29,636
I first heard the term
"Boston Strong"

1788
02:00:29,720 --> 02:00:31,517
about two days
into the investigation.

1789
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,197
And for me,
it was emblematic of

1790
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:37,397
how tough the city
and its residents can be.

1791
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:42,400
I'm a true patriot.
I really do believe in America.

1792
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:46,875
And I think Boston Strong,
it just shows that

1793
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:49,076
we're gonna stand up
and defend ourselves.

1794
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:52,232
We're not gonna take it
and be beaten down.

1795
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:53,992
We're not gonna bother you,

1796
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,992
but don't come at us because
we're gonna come back at ya.

1797
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,594
When's the last time
you saw crowds of people

1798
02:00:59,680 --> 02:01:01,238
cheering the police on like that?

1799
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:03,675
That brought tears to my eyes.
It really did.

1800
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:06,877
When we captured him,
it was the best feeling in the world.

1801
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,669
As a police officer, I don't ever
remember having a better feeling.

1802
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:12,876
It's almost like
we just won the war.

1803
02:01:13,960 --> 02:01:15,552
In the weeks after the bombings,

1804
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:17,790
when I had the opportunity
to visit many of the most

1805
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:20,633
severely injured Boston
Marathon bombing survivors,

1806
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:24,713
I was absolutely amazed
by the strength and resiliency

1807
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,837
of the human spirit
exhibited in these individuals.

1808
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:29,876
It was absolutely amazing.

1809
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:35,837
I think that day on Boylston Street,

1810
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,718
the bombers took lives and limbs...

1811
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:44,437
they took some of
our sense of security,

1812
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:48,195
but they took a lot less
than they intended.

1813
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,756
And they gave us back some
things they didn't intend us.

1814
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:55,992
They gave us a stronger sense
of community, of common cause.

1815
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:59,396
And I think we've seen that
in other examples around the world.

1816
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,991
When we see the news
that another attack has happened,

1817
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:07,356
in Brussels, Islamabad, Nice,

1818
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,193
Orlando, San Bernardino, Paris...

1819
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:13,829
I think it's important we think about
these people around the world

1820
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,913
not as victims of violence,
but ambassadors for peace.

1821
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,791
You know, I have a tremendous
amount of optimism

1822
02:02:35,880 --> 02:02:38,553
and hope for the future.

1823
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:40,870
Going forward with Leo,

1824
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:44,714
I hope that he views the world
with open eyes,

1825
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,793
lots of questions,
and a sense of humor.

1826
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:53,312
This has been the absolute worst
and lowest time in our lives,

1827
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,197
as well as the best.

1828
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:58,113
As bizarre as that is to say,

1829
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,111
and not that I don't miss my legs,

1830
02:03:00,200 --> 02:03:01,315
I miss them every day,

1831
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:04,039
but after being the recipients

1832
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:07,396
of such incredible care
and kindness,

1833
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:10,392
the very least I can do
is get out of bed and try again.

1834
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:14,393
And try to make this world
a little bit better for somebody else.

1835
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,911
About two years after the bombing,

1836
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,436
I got a running leg
and started to practice with it.

1837
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:25,229
But I still didn't know
I could get to the finish line

1838
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:28,676
until we took the turn
onto Boylston.

1839
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,989
That was the hardest stretch
of the race

1840
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:35,231
because it was
running past the spot

1841
02:03:35,320 --> 02:03:38,949
where a bomb had gone off
and changed our lives,

1842
02:03:39,040 --> 02:03:41,838
took the lives of three others.

1843
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:52,948
And here comes Patrick Downes.

1844
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:57,511
Patrick Downes,
who lost a leg in 2013,

1845
02:03:57,600 --> 02:03:59,989
met by his wife,
Jessica Kensky.

1846
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:09,357
There are great moments.
There are inspiring moments.

1847
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,440
There are moments
to savor and treasure.
