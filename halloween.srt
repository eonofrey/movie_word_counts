00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,840
I was a student of Dr. Loomis
before he passed away.

00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,042
And then I lobbied
the University of Illinois

to be assigned
to Michael myself.

Any progress?

64
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:30,583
Well, he's been seen by
over 50 clinical psychiatrists,

65
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,987
and with each,
many different opinions.

66
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,056
Dr. Loomis was the only one
to see him in the wild.

67
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,993
And he concluded he was
nothing more than pure evil.

72

And there he is.

73
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:57,144

74

You don't believe
in the Boogeyman?

00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:43,215
There was nothing.

00:13:43,217 --> 00:13:45,952
No response. Nothing.

222
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,921

00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,493

with you.

and then you gotta drive
in their pickup trucks,

and you clean their guns,
and you got children,

and you clean guns, and you
like to get high with them,

my grandmother tonight,

I mean, she never even
contacted her.

- Because I called her myself.

Why would she say that?

I don't know. She just tries
to keep me away from her.

Everyone in my family, like,

294
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,872

this time of year.

295
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:48,941
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't celebrate, either.

296
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:51,644
I would just put up
a Christmas tree instead.

297

Just skip all over the
creepy Halloween shit, right?

298
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:56,916
Does your grandma
ever talk about it?

299
00:16:56,918 --> 00:16:59,084
Yeah, it's pretty much
all she talks about.

300
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,453
It defines her life.

301
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,422
She's been traumatized
ever since.

302
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:05,524
Wasn't it her brother
who, like,

00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:07,127
cold-blooded murdilated
all those teenagers?

No.

305
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:10,529
That's just a bit
that some people made up

306
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,965
to make them feel better,
I think.

307
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,633
I mean, that is scary to have
a bunch of your friends

308
00:17:14,635 --> 00:17:15,969
get butchered
by some random crazy person.

309
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:18,138
Is it, though?
Because, all things considered,

310
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,740
there's a lot worse stuff
that's happening today.

311
00:17:20,742 --> 00:17:23,176

a couple people getting killed

312
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:26,079
by one guy with a knife
is not that big of a deal.

313
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:28,548
Dude, her grandmother
was almost fucking murdered.

314
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,518
And she escaped,
and they caught him,

315
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,119
and now he's incarcerated.

316
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,489
I-I'm just saying, like,
by today's standards...

Just shut the fuck up, Dave.

Shut up.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah, shut up, Dave.
